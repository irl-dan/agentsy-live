  - compiler.md language specification extracted
  - SKILL.md activation guidelines documented
  - 4 state management approaches identified (filesystem, in-context, SQLite, PostgreSQL)

  - Explicit user responsibility framework documented
  - Privacy policy analyzed (telemetry opt-out available)
  - Terms of Service reviewed (no warranty, user liable for agent actions)
  - Safety design patterns identified
  - Open questions/risks noted

✓ PULSE (Adoption Metrics)
  - 721 GitHub stars in ~29 days (strong signal)

KEY FINDINGS FOR AGENTSY.LIVE INDEX
================================================================================

PROJECT CLASSIFICATION:
  Type: Protocol-Level Specification (Language + VM)
  Status: Beta (not production-ready, acknowledged)
  Launch Date: 2026-01-03 (29 days at crawl time)
  Maturity: High (comprehensive docs, 37 examples, active development)

THREAT ASSESSMENT:
  Level: LOW
  Reasoning:
    - Explicit user responsibility acknowledged
    - Open source (MIT license)
    - Transparent privacy/telemetry policies
    - No lock-in (portable across platforms)
    - Active maintenance and responsive to issues

ADOPTION SIGNALS:
  - 721 stars (strong for 29-day-old project)
  - 62 forks (suggests active experimentation)
  - Daily commits through Jan 31
  - Multi-platform support (Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp)
  - Constellation Commons pattern suggests ecosystem thinking

EMERGING PATTERNS:
  - Self-executing inside AI sessions (not external orchestration)
  - Intelligent control flow (AI-evaluated conditions via "Fourth Wall")
  - Constellation architecture suggests movement toward distributed AI governance
  - Persistent agents can maintain state across projects
  - WebShell skill (recent) adds web navigation capabilities

TRUST INDICATORS:
  + MIT Licensed
  + Open specification-driven design
  + Telemetry opt-out available
  + Transparent Terms of Service
  + Active maintenance (irl-dan commits through Jan 31)
  + Comprehensive documentation
  - Still beta (not production-ready)
  - User bears full responsibility for agent actions
  - No external validation/certification

CRAWLER EFFICIENCY NOTES
================================================================================

Crawl Strategy: FAST_CRAWLER
  - Focused research on protocol specifications
  - Prioritized core documentation files
  - Extracted key metrics and recent activity
  - Cross-referenced watched topics
  - No unnecessary deep dives into unrelated repos
