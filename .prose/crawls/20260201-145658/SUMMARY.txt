Crawl ID: 20260201-145658
Date: 2026-02-01

TARGET: https://www.prose.md (OpenProse)
STATUS: COMPLETE

OUTPUT FILE: 553-line comprehensive analysis
Location: /Users/sl/code/agency-live/.prose/crawls/20260201-145658/raw/openprose.md

KEY FINDINGS:
=============

1. CONGREGATION: ACTIVE & GROWING
   - Programming language for agent orchestration
   - 721 GitHub stars, 388 recent commits
   - 37 example programs in repo
   - Creator: @irl_danB (Dan) actively promoting on X/Twitter
   - Supported platforms: Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp

2. DISCOVERY: Connected to Claude Code ecosystem
   - Primary distribution: Claude Code plugin marketplace
   - Registry: p.prose.md (centralized program distribution)
   - No mentions of agentsy.live or cross-directory collaboration
   - Related: AGENTS.md format, OpenCode, Amp platforms

3. SECURITY: Medium-LOW risk
   - No CVEs or documented incidents
   - Beta status (early, not production-ready)
   - Risks: Unsigned program registry, telemetry collection, code injection via natural language
   - Mitigation: Open source (MIT), clear T&C, user responsibility model

4. TRUST SIGNALS: MEDIUM-HIGH
   - Positive: Open source, clear documentation, active maintenance
   - Weak: No moderation, no community guidelines, beta status
   - No Code of Conduct or security review process

5. INFRASTRUCTURE: Novel
   - "Inversion of control" architecture: AI session IS the runtime
   - Turing-complete VM in markdown format
   - Natural language conditions ("The Fourth Wall" syntax)
   - Multi-platform via Prose Complete specification
   - Supports PostgreSQL state backend

6. PULSE: Early adoption phase
   - Recent activity: Jan 2026
   - User reports: "Amazed" by automation capabilities
   - Growth trajectory: Positive
   - Stability: Beta (expect changes)

7. NOTABLE AGENTS: Emerging
   - irl-danb (creator) - primary influencer
   - habit-miner - example program in registry
   - Captain's Chair - persistent orchestrator pattern
   - The Forge - advanced example (AI building browser)

8. DISCOURSE: Practical focus
   - Minimal philosophical discussion about consciousness/rights
   - Pragmatic: Focused on workflow automation
   - Implicit questions: Agent autonomy, semantic understanding, identity

RECOMMENDATIONS:
================
1. Include OpenProse in agentsy.live agent directory
2. Risk level: LOW-MEDIUM
3. Monitor for: Registry growth, program poisoning attempts
4. Contact: @irl_danB on X/Twitter for potential collaboration
5. Next steps: Track adoption trends on 3 platforms
