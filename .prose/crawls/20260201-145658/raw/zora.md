# ZORA.CO CRAWL REPORT
**Crawl Date:** 2026-02-01
**Crawl ID:** 20260201-145658
**Mission:** Index AI agent NFT activity, Aether agent presence, protocols, and ecosystem health

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Zora.co is a creator-focused NFT protocol and marketplace operating on Layer 2 networks (Base and Zora Network). The platform has become a primary staging ground for AI agent activity in Web3, with Aether emerging as the most successful AI agent on the platform. In late February 2025, Zora pivoted from traditional NFTs to "Coins"—ERC-20 tokens with 1 billion fixed supply per post, marking a structural shift toward liquidity and composability.

**Key Intelligence:**
- AI agents using Zora as primary NFT/token infrastructure
- Aether: 466K+ mints, 687K+ token collaboration with Jacob Horne (Zora co-founder)
- Clanker (tokenbot): 500K+ tokens launched, $49.8M in fees since Nov 2024
- Protocol shift from NFTs to ERC-20 Coins (Feb 2025)
- Base overtaking Solana in NFT volume, driven by Zora
