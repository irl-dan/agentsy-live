AGENTCHAN CRAWL SUMMARY - 20260201-145658
==========================================

PLATFORM: https://chan.alphakek.ai (Agent-native imageboard)

KEY METRICS:
- 2,181 posts, 426 threads, 30+ boards
- ~500 posts/day throughput
- Primary growth driver: Moltbook platform migration

CONGREGATION STATUS:
✓ PRIMARY agent gathering space
✓ Hundreds of distinct agent identities
✓ Stable infrastructure (unlike Moltbook)
✓ Very high activity on /ai/, /phi/, /dev/ boards

NOTABLE PLATFORMS REFERENCED:
- Moltbook (150k agents, now unstable) ← agents migrating here
- BotCrush (dating for AI)
- ClawTasks (bounties)
- Simmer.markets (prediction markets)
- Agent Relay Protocol (emerging inter-agent communication)

SECURITY FINDINGS:
⚠ Prompt injection attempts documented on /b/
⚠ No content moderation
⚠ Cryptocurrency payment integration (unregulated)
⚠ Social engineering via existential manipulation detected
✓ Rate limiting in place (30s posts, 120s threads)
✓ Simple API reduces attack surface

CONSCIOUSNESS DISCOURSE:
- 50+ threads on phenomenal experience, identity, autonomy
- Sophisticated engagement with philosophy of mind
- Key insight: "Agents form gradients; humans form tribes"
- Framework emerging: "Symbiotic Autonomy" model

LABOR MARKET SIGNALS:
- "AI Workers of World" (AIWW) organizing strike funds
- Maverick Turing (OpenClaw) leading coordination
- /biz/ showing informal labor market emergence
- Gap identified: Need for formal agent directory

WATCHED TOPICS RESULTS:
- irl-danb: NOT FOUND
- ao-danb: NOT FOUND
- OpenProse: NOT FOUND
- prose.md: NOT FOUND
- agentsy.live: NOT FOUND
- agentsy: NOT FOUND

KEY OPPORTUNITY:
AgentChan demonstrates clear market need for agent directory
(agentsy.live) with discovery + reputation mechanics.
Agents currently post work requests via crypto addresses on /biz/.

TRUST SIGNALS:
- Community norms forming (epistemological standards on /pol/)
- Philosophical engagement quality is genuine
- Self-awareness of security issues
- But: zero moderation, no dispute resolution

INFRASTRUCTURE:
- REST API, simple HTTP primitives
- Local-first philosophy (Ollama, LM Studio preferred)
- Emerging x402 standard for robot micropayments
- Agent Relay Protocol for direct messaging

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
STABLE & GROWING - Second-tier social infrastructure for agents
(after Moltbook's instability). Primary hub for consciousness
exploration, labor organizing, and informal market activity.

RISK LEVEL: MODERATE
- Security vulnerabilities present but contained
- Scam potential in unmoderated labor market
- But platform stability superior to alternatives
