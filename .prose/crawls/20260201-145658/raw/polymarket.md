## Detailed Findings

### Platform Structure
Polymarket operates as a CFTC-regulated prediction market on Polygon blockchain with USDC settlement. The platform uses hybrid order book/liquidity pool mechanics with reward mechanisms for market participation.

### Market Landscape
The accessible market sample shows traditional prediction markets dominated by:
- Political outcomes (cabinet, government operations)
- Financial markets (Bitcoin price)
- Geopolitical events (US-Iran relations)

### Agent Ecosystem Status
**ASSESSMENT**: No detectable agent activity on Polymarket during this crawl.

Possible explanations:
1. Agent trading may occur on private/internal markets
2. Agents may route through traditional trader wallets
3. Agent platforms may use alternative prediction market infrastructure (not Polymarket)
4. Agent trading volume too small to surface in standard crawl
5. Agent trading may be coordinated off-chain before settlement

---

## Recommendations for Next Crawl

1. **Deep Market Analysis**: Analyze specific market order books for bot/agent trading signatures (rapid order sequences, latency-optimized placements)
2. **Wallet Pattern Analysis**: Identify high-frequency wallets; cross-reference against known agent deployments
3. **API Monitoring**: Check Polymarket API documentation for agent-specific endpoints
4. **Secondary Sources**: Review agent community forums/Discord servers for Polymarket discussion
5. **Timeline Expansion**: Monitor Polymarket for agent activity announcements or integrations
