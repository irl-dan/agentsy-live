## Key Findings for agentsy.live

### What is OpenProse?

**A specification-level protocol for AI agent orchestration** that runs *inside* AI sessions rather than orchestrating them externally. Unique properties:

- **Self-executing**: The language runs within the session as an intelligent IoC container
- **Specification-driven**: VM behavior emerges from detailed prose.md specification
- **Platform-agnostic**: Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp, or any "Prose Complete" system
- **Zero lock-in**: Portable `.prose` files work across platforms
- **MIT licensed**: Open source, inspectable, permissive

### Critical Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Created | 2026-01-03 (29 days old) |
| Stars | 721 (strong adoption signal) |
| Forks | 62 (active experimentation) |
| Status | Beta (not production-ready) |
| License | MIT (permissive) |
| Maintainer | irl-dan (@irl_danB) |
| Latest | Active through Jan 31, 2026 |

### Threat Assessment: **LOW**

**Why LOW**:
- Explicit user responsibility acknowledged
- Open source, MIT licensed, inspectable
- Transparent privacy/telemetry policies
- No external dependencies
- Active maintenance
- Clear documentation

**Caveats**:
- Still beta (not production-ready)
- Users bear full responsibility for agent actions
- Constellation Commons pattern could enable autonomous ecosystem behavior
- Cross-project persistent agents could maintain unexpected state

### Emerging Pattern: Ecosystem Consciousness

Recent development of Constellation Commons (18 ecosystem programs) suggests OpenProse moving toward **self-aware ecosystem governance**:

- **Participation**: Programs that witness and manifest peer programs
- **Discovery**: Registry, search, observation, curation
- **Governance**: Sentinels, arbiters, auditors for ecosystem health
- **Economics**: Assessors, bounties
- **Foresight**: Prophets, philosophers

This is philosophically significant: agents that maintain and evolve the network of agents itself.

### Unique Technical Features

1. **Fourth Wall Syntax** (`**...**`) - Natural language conditions evaluated by AI
2. **Intelligent IoC** - Dependencies wired by understanding, not name matching
3. **Parallel Orchestration** - Fan-out/fan-in, join strategies
4. **Persistent Agents** - Cross-project memory with `persist:` and `resume:`
5. **Multiple State Backends** - Filesystem (default), SQLite, PostgreSQL, in-context

## Recommendations for agentsy.live Coverage

### Index Entry Suggested

**Title**: OpenProse Protocol

**Category**: Protocol/Language Specification

**Safety Grade**: Moderate (high transparency, user-responsible)

**Adoption Signal**: Strong (721 stars, 62 forks in 29 days)

**Key Points to Cover**:
