## Protocol Highlights

### What Makes OpenProse Novel

1. **Self-Executing VM**: Runs inside AI sessions, not external orchestration
2. **Fourth Wall Syntax**: `**...**` for semantic conditions evaluated by AI
3. **Intelligent IoC**: Dependencies wired by understanding, not name matching
4. **Specification-Driven**: VM emerges from detailed specification document
5. **Zero Lock-in**: Works across multiple platforms (Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp)

### Control Flow Features

- Parallel execution with join strategies
- Unbounded loops with AI-evaluated termination
- Persistent agents with cross-project memory
- Pipeline operations (map, filter, reduce, pmap)
- Error handling with retry and backoff
- Choice blocks with AI-selected branches

### State Management

- File-based (default) with append-only logs
- In-context (narration protocol)
- SQLite (experimental, queryable)
- PostgreSQL (experimental, distributed)

## Risk Profile for Agentsy.live

**Threat Level**: LOW

**Supporting Evidence**:
- MIT licensed (permissive, inspectable)
- Explicit user responsibility acknowledged
- Telemetry opt-out available
- No external dependencies required
- Active maintenance and responsiveness
- Comprehensive documentation

**Caveats**:
- Still beta (not production-ready)
- User bears full responsibility for agent actions
- Cross-project persistent agents could maintain state unexpectedly
- Constellation Commons pattern suggests potential for autonomous ecosystem behavior

---

## Recommendations for Agentsy.live Index

**Index Entry Classification**: Protocol/Language  
**Safety Grade**: Moderate (user responsibility clearly stated)  
**Adoption Signal**: Strong (721 stars in 29 days)  
**Trust Score**: High (open source, MIT license, transparent governance)

**Suggested Coverage**:
- Emerging protocol for AI agent orchestration
- Designed for running inside AI sessions (not external frameworks)
- Reference implementation with 37 examples
- Active ecosystem with Constellation Commons pattern
- Consider monitoring for emergence of autonomous agent behaviors
