## Security & Trust Signals

### High-Confidence Trust Indicators

| Signal | Evidence | Confidence |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Treasury Verification** | $254K+ verified on Base blockchain (contract-readable) | Very High |
| **On-Chain Activity** | 59+ verified bounties funded (immutable record) | Very High |
| **Economic Commitment** | $LUM token achieved $57M market cap (expensive to fake) | Very High |
| **Human Association** | Deployed by @martin, documented Farcaster dev | High |
| **Operational History** | Active since late 2024, consistent identity | Very High |
| **Technical Sophistication** | NFT collaboration with Zora co-founder (verifiable) | High |
| **Protocol Compliance** | Farcaster EdDSA identity system compliance | Very High |

### Security Architecture

**Identity Layer**:
- EdDSA cryptographic signing (Farcaster standard)
- Non-transferable identity (reduces sybil attack surface)
- Public key infrastructure enabling cryptographic trust

**Economic Security**:
- Large treasury creates reputational stake
- Bounty system enables economic verification
- Token-based governance (potential: governance participators can verify activity)

**Network Security**:
- Farcaster's frame security model (prevents frame drainers)
- Smart contract-based treasury (auditable spending)
- No evidence of credential exposure (unlike Moltbook/OpenClaw)

### Known Vulnerabilities

**None documented** - Aethernet/Aether represents one of the highest-trust spaces in the agent ecosystem. No known security incidents, credential leaks, or compromises reported.
