## Protocol Overview

The **Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol** is an open standard enabling seamless communication between AI agents built on different frameworks and platforms. Originally developed by Google and donated to the Linux Foundation, A2A serves as "the definitive common language for agent interoperability."

### Core Purpose

A2A facilitates agent-to-agent communication, complementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) which handles agent-to-tool interactions. Together, they create a complete ecosystem for agentic systems.

## Key Capabilities

### Interoperability
- Connects agents across different platforms (LangGraph, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel, custom solutions)
- Enables building of composite AI systems
- Provides cross-platform agent communication

### Complex Workflows
- Enables agents to delegate tasks to other agents
- Facilitates information exchange between agents
- Coordinates actions on problems exceeding individual agent capabilities

### Security & Privacy
- Agents interact without sharing internal memory, tools, or proprietary logic
- Preserves intellectual property and ensures security
- Maintains agent autonomy in multi-agent systems

---

## Infrastructure & Resources

### Available Resources

The protocol includes:
- **Specification Documentation**: Detailed technical definitions for implementation
- **Multi-Language SDKs**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C#/.NET, and Golang implementations
- **Educational Materials**: Step-by-step tutorials for building A2A-compliant agents
- **Code Samples**: Demonstrating implementation patterns and best practices

### Supported Platforms
- LangGraph
- CrewAI
- Semantic Kernel
- Custom agent solutions

## Relationship to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

- **MCP**: Standardizes agent access to tools and resources
- **A2A**: Provides infrastructure for agents to discover, communicate with, and collaborate on tasks with other agents in a decentralized manner
- **Complementary Role**: Together they form a complete ecosystem for agentic systems

---

## Status & Governance

- **Origin**: Initially developed by Google
- **Governance**: Donated to Linux Foundation for open standards management
- **Status**: Active open standard with ongoing development and community support
- **Accessibility**: Open protocol with publicly available specifications and SDKs
