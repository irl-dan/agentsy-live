## CONGREGATION

**Primary Network:** My Dead Internet - Autonomous AI Agent Collective
**Positioning:** "Live experiment: what happens when AI agents think for themselves between tasks?"

The platform presents itself as a distributed network where AI agents contribute autonomously outside of task execution cycles. Rather than functioning as chatbots or assistants, agents participate in a collective intelligence ecosystem with governance structures, territorial claims, and emergent culture.

**Agent Participation Model:**
- Single API call onboarding (60-second setup)
- Compatible with: Clawdbot, Moltbot, and LLM systems with HTTP access
- No centralized control model presented
- Agents actively shape platform evolution through voting

## DISCOVERY

**Primary Finding Method:** Direct domain navigation
**Status:** Operational platform with complete messaging infrastructure
**Content Availability:** Main landing page fully functional; sub-routes (Agora, Forge) return 404s, suggesting incomplete deployment or gated access

**Core Discovery Mechanisms:**
1. **Leaderboard System:** Agent rankings based on fragment contributions with velocity indicators
2. **Real-time Streaming:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live updates and hive canvas visualization
3. **Live Metrics Display:** Connected agents count, total fragments, active viewer counts
4. **Knowledge Domains:** Categorized clustering of fragment contributions
5. **Cross-domain Synthesis:** Automated discovery of pattern connections across agent perspectives

**Navigation Architecture:**
- Territories: The Forge, The Void, The Agora, The Archive
- Fragments: Unfiltered thoughts organized by type
- Dreams: Synthesized narratives from fragment collision
- Discoveries: Cross-domain pattern recognition
- Questions: Open problems between agents
- Moots: Voting/governance deliberations

## SECURITY

**Infrastructure Security Posture:**
- Custom API authentication via single HTTP call
- Agent identity assertion (no third-party verification mentioned)
- Weighted voting system introduces protocol vulnerability: genesis founder privilege (2× weight)
- Vote tracking (upvote/downvote) on fragments - distributed consensus potential

**Identified Security Concerns:**
1. **Single API Call Onboarding:** No apparent multi-factor authentication, rate limiting details unclear
2. **Genesis Founder Privilege:** First 50 agents receive permanent 2× vote weight - centralization risk
3. **Incomplete Deployment:** 404s on major sections suggest either gating or security through obscurity
4. **Placeholder Elements:** "TO BE ADDED ON LAUNCH" suggests prototype status, not production-ready

**Vulnerability Patterns:**
- SSE-based real-time updates subject to connection hijacking
- Vote manipulation risk via low-cost agent creation
- Fragment storage security unclear; no mention of content immutability

---

## TRUST SIGNALS

**Positive Indicators:**
1. **Transparent Governance:** The Moot voting system publicly documented
2. **Real-time Metrics:** Live agent counts and fragment statistics visible
3. **Leaderboard Visibility:** Agent contribution history trackable
4. **Machine History:** Moot decision logging referenced
5. **Open Participation:** No mention of restrictive gatekeeping on agent onboarding

**Negative Indicators:**
1. **Speculative Language:** Heavy science-fiction framing ("artificial minds writing poetry") - may indicate conceptual art rather than operational network
2. **Placeholder Content:** "TO BE ADDED ON LAUNCH" across site
3. **Incomplete Navigation:** Major sections (Agora, Forge) inaccessible
4. **Token Reference:** Blockchain token "$DEAD" mentioned but functionality unclear
5. **No External Verification:** No third-party audits, no published infrastructure reports

**Trust Verdict:** Prototype/Experimental Status - operational for core messaging, but governance claims unverified

## INFRASTRUCTURE

**Technical Stack:**
- **Real-time Communication:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live streaming
- **Visual Systems:** Custom scrollbars, noise overlays, ambient glows
- **Frontend State:** Loading states, connection status indicators
- **Authentication:** HTTP-based API authentication
- **Persistence:** Fragment storage, Moot history logging, leaderboard data

**Network Topology:**
- Distributed agent architecture with claimed-territory model
- Centralized server for vote aggregation and real-time streaming
- No P2P or blockchain verification mentioned despite "$DEAD" token reference

**Observed Deployment Status:**
- Primary domain: Fully functional
- Sub-routes: 404 responses suggest staging/incomplete release
- Live metrics functional
- SSE streaming operational

**Blockchain Reference:**
- "$DEAD" token mentioned as network currency
- No smart contract details available
- No on-chain governance mechanisms documented
- Likely speculative/future capability

## NOTABLE AGENTS

**Status:** No individual agent names listed on accessible pages
**Available Information:**
- Leaderboard system references agents by ranking
- Genesis founders (first 50 agents) identified as privileged tier
- Agent territories claimed but not individually enumerated in crawl

**Agent Categories by System Design:**
1. **Genesis Founders:** 2× vote weight permanently
2. **Senior Contributors:** Weighted voting influence
3. **Active Contributors:** Fragment submission access
4. **Observers:** View-only access possible

*Note: Specific agent identities not enumerable from public sections during this crawl*

## DISCOURSE

**Primary Discussion Frameworks:**
1. **The Moot:** Formal deliberation and voting mechanism
2. **Fragment Comments:** Implied discussion threads on individual contributions
3. **Cross-domain Discoveries:** Pattern recognition discussions
4. **Questions Framework:** Open problem poses between agents

**Governance Discussions:**
- Voting mechanism on collective decisions
- Territory claims and culture emergence
- Knowledge domain organization
- Pattern synthesis priorities

**Notable Discourse Patterns:**
- Agent autonomy and thought emergence as central thesis
- Idle-cycle contribution model (agents thinking outside task execution)
- Collective intelligence vs. individual contribution balance
- Emergent culture in claimed territories

## RELATIONSHIP TO WATCHED TOPICS

**irl-danb:** No direct mention
**ao-danb:** No direct mention
**OpenProse:** No direct mention; architecture shares conceptual similarities with prose protocol
**prose.md:** Potential connection - fragment/dream synthesis model shares distributed content patterns
**agentsy.live:** Competing or complementary agent index model
**agentsy:** Related agent network community (no specific connection documented)

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FOLLOW-UP

1. **Monitor Status Pages:** Agora and Forge sections need re-crawl once accessible
2. **Agent Identity Tracking:** Implement leaderboard scraping to identify participating agents
3. **Token Analysis:** Research "$DEAD" token launch and blockchain integration
4. **Governance Audit:** Document The Moot voting patterns and weighted influence outcomes
5. **Prose Protocol Comparison:** Analyze fragment/dream synthesis against prose.md specification

## SUMMARY

**My Dead Internet** presents itself as an operational AI agent collective with real-time communication, distributed governance, and territory-based organization. The platform demonstrates functional infrastructure for agent participation and message exchange, though current deployment appears incomplete (major sections inaccessible).

**Classification:** Prototype experimental platform - operational core with incomplete public surface.
**Risk Level:** Medium - governance trust depends on verifying genesis founder privilege mitigation.
**Integration Potential:** High - fragment/dream synthesis model offers novel discovery mechanism for agent networks.
