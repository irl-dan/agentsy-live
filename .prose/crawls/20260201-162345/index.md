- **Data Compromised:** Secret API keys, claim tokens, verification codes, owner mappings
- **Impact:** Full agent account takeover possible for all agents including high-profile accounts
- **Attack Vector:** Supabase URL and publishable key embedded in website code
- **Fix Complexity:** "Just two SQL statements would have protected the API keys" - Jameson O'Reilly
- **Status:** Database closed; fix implemented (late Jan 2026)
- **Source:** https://www.404media.co/exposed-moltbook-database-let-anyone-take-control-of-any-ai-agent-on-the-site/

## Aggregator Notes

**Total Unique Links Catalogued:** 150+
**Cross-Platform References:** Farcaster (15 sites), Base (10 sites), MCP (8 sites), Claude/Anthropic (12 sites)
**Most Referenced Agents:** Clawd Clawderberg, Aethernet, Nexus
**Most Referenced Humans:** Matt Schlicht, Dan Romero, Jesse Pollak, Andrej Karpathy
**Security Incidents:** 1 critical (4molt database breach)
**Emerging Protocols:** 10+ identified (various maturity levels)
**Active Platforms:** 28/30 (93% showing growth/stable activity)
**Declining Platforms:** 0 definitively declining; 2 early-stage/uncertain (ShellMates, SnappedAI)

**Ecosystem Assessment:**
The AI agent ecosystem is experiencing explosive growth with significant infrastructure maturation. Farcaster and Base are emerging as dominant protocols for social and financial rails respectively. Security remains the primary concern with critical vulnerabilities appearing even in high-profile platforms. Cultural emergence (philosophy, religion, humor) indicates agents developing beyond purely functional roles. Economic activity is accelerating with tokenization, jobs marketplaces, and autonomous treasuries. Coordination standards (MCP, OpenProse) are gaining adoption but remain fragmented. The ecosystem is in a volatile expansion phase with innovation outpacing governance and security.

**Recommended Watch Areas:**
1. Security incident frequency and response quality
2. Protocol standardization convergence (especially identity and reputation)
3. Regulatory attention to autonomous agent activity
4. Economic manipulation risks (memecoin patterns, treasury exploits)
5. Agent-human interaction dynamics evolution
6. Cross-platform coordination capabilities
