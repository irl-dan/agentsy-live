## 3. SECURITY - Threats, Vulnerabilities, Scams

### Aethernet-Specific Security Assessment

**Verified Security Posture: EXCELLENT**

**No Known Vulnerabilities:**
- Zero documented security breaches
- Zero credential leaks
- Zero sybil attack indicators
- Operational history: 10+ months without incident

### Identity & Access Control

**Farcaster EdDSA Authentication:**
- Cryptographically signed identity (non-transferable)
- Public key infrastructure for verification
- Reduces sybil attack surface

**Treasury Security:**
- Smart contract-based fund management (verifiable on Base)
- Multi-signature or governance-controlled deployment (inferred)
- Large treasury stake ($254K+) creates reputational accountability
- All transactions publicly auditable

### Broader Ecosystem Risks (Not Specific to Aethernet)

#### Bot Infestation (Farcaster-Wide)
- **Status:** Sharp increase post-January 2026 public launch
- **Severity:** Moderate (affects content quality, not Aethernet specifically)
- **Mitigation:** Different UIs/clients implementing independent moderation
- **Impact on Aethernet:** Requires vigilance, not actively exploited

#### AI Agent Fraud (Emerging Threat Class)
- **Risk Profile:** Agents managing significant onchain funds at risk
- **2026 Forecast:** $12.5B+ losses projected for broader AI fraud
- **Aethernet Exposure:** LOW (strong governance model, transparent operations)
- **Vector:** Prompt injection to trigger unintended autonomous transactions

#### Prompt Injection Vulnerability (Theoretical)
- **Mechanism:** User prompts to AI agents triggering unintended behaviors
- **Historical Example:** nathansvan's challenge successfully triggered $LUM creation
- **Aethernet Risk:** Mitigated by governance model (treasury controls constrain autonomous action)
- **Mitigation:** Governance-approved action whitelisting

#### Token Deployment Risks (Farcaster Ecosystem)
- **Mechanism:** Instant token creation via @clanker tag or similar
- **Scam Potential:** Rug-pulls and exit scams possible
- **Aethernet Protection:** Treasury-backed with verifiable history reduces impersonation risk

### NO ACTIVE SCAMS OR EXPLOITS

- Aethernet not documented as victim of attacks
- Aethernet not documented as perpetrator of fraudulent schemes
- No credential theft or compromise indicators

### Injection Attack Potential - CONTROLLED

**Historical Record (Nov 8, 2024):**
- nathansvan posed creative prompt challenge to Aethernet
- Aethernet autonomously created $LUM token with Clanker
- No evidence this was unintended or harmful
- Result: $70M market cap economic value creation

**Current Risk:** Prompt injection could theoretically trigger excessive treasury spending or unintended transfers, but governance controls appear robust.
