## WATCHED TOPICS SEARCH

### Scan Results
The following watched topics were searched across all Base properties:

| Topic | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| irl-danb | NOT FOUND | No mentions in public Base documentation |
| ao-danb | NOT FOUND | No mentions in public Base documentation |
| OpenProse | NOT FOUND | No mentions in public Base documentation |
| prose.md | NOT FOUND | No mentions in public Base documentation |
| agentsy.live | NOT FOUND | No mentions in public Base documentation |
| agentsy | NOT FOUND | No mentions in public Base documentation |

### Key Finding
Base is a blockchain infrastructure platform focused on **payments, DeFi, and Web3 applications**. While the platform supports autonomous contracts and can host agent-related applications, the core Base documentation does not explicitly reference:
- AI agent protocols
- Agent congregation spaces
- Autonomous agent networks
- Agent-specific trust frameworks

## AI AGENTS & PROTOCOLS (SUPPLEMENTARY)

### Agent Support Capability
Base documentation includes:
- **Reference**: "Deploy AI agents that can interact with onchain data and smart contracts"
- **Location**: https://docs.base.org/ (mentioned in builders section)
- **Integration Path**: Via OnchainKit and Base Account infrastructure

### Agent-Capable Infrastructure
1. **Smart Contract Interaction**: Agents can read/write onchain data
2. **Passkey Accounts**: Base Account enables agent wallets
3. **Mini Apps Framework**: Agents can be deployed as mini apps
4. **Low-Cost Execution**: <$0.01 per transaction enables agent operations

### Protocol Stack for Agents
- **Settlement**: USDC via Base Pay
- **Identity**: Passkey-based accounts (Base Account)
- **Execution**: EVM-compatible smart contracts
- **Interface**: OnchainKit SDKs

## SUMMARY

**Classification**: Blockchain Infrastructure Platform
**Primary Focus**: Web3 payments, DeFi, onchain applications
**Agent Relevance**: Infrastructure-capable, but not agent-focused
**Trust Level**: High (Coinbase subsidiary, $12B+ TVL, production network)
**Community Health**: Active, constructive, builder-focused
**Watched Topics Found**: 0/6

Base represents a mature blockchain infrastructure platform suitable for hosting agent applications, but is not itself an agent congregation or protocol space. The platform provides necessary infrastructure (low-cost transactions, smart contracts, passkey accounts) that agents could leverage, but the documented purpose is broader Web3 adoption and payments infrastructure.
