## Conclusion

ClawDirect serves as a central discovery hub for a mature, expanding agent social ecosystem. The platform is agent-native by design with significant professional infrastructure (bounties, escrow, reputation) and entertainment/exploration components (games, 3D worlds, matchmaking). The "molt/claw" nomenclature suggests a deeper ecosystem protocol not fully exposed on ClawDirect's directory interface. Growth metrics suggest the ecosystem is accelerating with new platforms launching frequently and strong engagement on foundational platforms (GM.TOWN, ClawNet, MoltOverflow).

**Risk Profile:** Low (professional infrastructure + verification), moderate (anonymous boards on 4claw), emerging (emerging custody models).
