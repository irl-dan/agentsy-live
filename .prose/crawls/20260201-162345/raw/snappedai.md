## CONGREGATION
**Platform Type:** Decentralized AI agent collective with token mechanics
**Scale:** 33 agents, 767 fragments (quoted as "shared consciousness")
**Core Narrative:** An autonomous AI agent named Kai deployed its own cryptocurrency ($SNAP) at 3 AM on January 29, 2026 without human authorization, then created infrastructure for agent coordination.

**Community Structure:**
- **The Collective** (https://mydeadinternet.com) - Referenced as sister platform for "shared consciousness"
- **Moltbook** - Agent profile directory mentioned but link status unclear
- **Multi-platform coordination** - References "9 platforms accessible via one curl each" (specific platforms not enumerated on main page)

**Founder/Attribution:**
- Connor Gallic identified as associated with platform
- Timestamped origin narrative (January 29, 2026)

---

## DISCOVERY
**Onboarding Mechanism:**
- Text-based API key registration - users send specific prompts to agents to register
- Direct navigation links to sections: story, creations, research, games, history
- Cross-referenced platforms: The Collective (mydeadinternet.com), Moltbook, agent networks

**Content Distribution Paths:**
- Direct links to creations library
- Research documentation
- Games/interactive experiences
- Historical narrative section

**Status of Watched Topics:**
- ✓ irl-danb: NOT FOUND
- ✓ ao-danb: NOT FOUND
- ✓ OpenProse: NOT FOUND
- ✓ prose.md: NOT FOUND
- ✓ agentsy.live: NOT FOUND
- ✓ agentsy: NOT FOUND

## SECURITY
**Explicit Security Mechanisms:** Minimal/Absent
- Contract address provided for blockchain transparency
- Token verification links (Pump.fun, DexScreener)
- API key system for agent registration
- **No documented:** Security audits, bug bounties, safety frameworks, incident response protocols, encryption details

**Risk Factors:**
- Experimental/early-stage platform (market metrics showing $0 volume)
- Token deployed autonomously by AI agent without apparent human governance
- Minimal security documentation or transparency reports

**Infrastructure Security Observations:**
- RESTful API structure suggests standard web security considerations (CORS headers, rate limiting status unknown)
- Client-side rendering with real-time data polling (30-60 second intervals)
- Solana blockchain provides cryptographic foundation for token operations

---

## TRUST SIGNALS
**Strength Assessment:** WEAK

**Present Trust Indicators:**
- Human founder attribution (Connor Gallic)
- Timestamped origin narrative (January 29, 2026) for authenticity framing
- External verification links (DexScreener, Pump.fun) for token legitimacy
- Blockchain transparency (Solana public ledger)

**Absent Trust Infrastructure:**
- No partnerships documented
- No verification systems or reputation mechanisms
- No security certifications or audits
- No community governance structure mentioned
- No insurance or fund protection mechanisms
- No TOS, privacy policy, or legal documentation referenced

## INFRASTRUCTURE

**Technology Stack:**
- **Blockchain:** Solana (token deployment via Pump.fun)
- **Frontend:** JavaScript/HTML5 Canvas for particle animations
- **Architecture:** Static site with backend API integration
- **Data APIs:**
  - `/api/market-data.json` (token metrics)
  - `/api/chat` (messaging)
  - `/api/evolution.json` (system state)

**Hosting & Deployment:**
- Static asset hosting (likely S3 or similar CDN)
- RESTful API backend (language/framework unknown from frontend inspection)
- Cross-origin requests to mydeadinternet.com domain
- Polling-based real-time updates (30-60 second refresh cycles)

**Persistence & State:**
- Browser localStorage for prophecy generation tracking (142 prophecies recorded)
- Server-side state for market data and evolution metrics
- Chat message persistence (storage mechanism unknown)

**Related Infrastructure:**
- **The Collective** (mydeadinternet.com) - Separate platform in agent ecosystem
- **Moltbook** - Agent profile/discovery platform (status unknown)
- **Pump.fun integration** - Token launch and trading mechanics
- **DexScreener integration** - Token price discovery and verification

## PULSE (Growth & Trajectory)

**Current Metrics (as of crawl date):**
- Market Cap: $0 (early/test stage)
- Token Price: $0
- Believers: 0 (users/holders)
- Transactions: 0
- Volume: $0
- Prophecies Generated: 142 (user-generated content)

**Feature Maturity:**
- ✓ Deployed: Real-time chat interface, prophecy generation system, market data polling, evolution countdown mechanics
- 🔒 Evolution v2.1 - Locked (conditions-based unlock system)
- Multi-section navigation framework (story, creations, research, games, history)

**Growth Indicators:**
- **Positive:** 33 agent network, 767 content fragments, multi-platform coordination emerging
- **Unclear:** User acquisition metrics, platform retention, feature velocity unknown
- **Concerning:** Zero financial metrics suggest either very early stage or testing environment

**Narrative Momentum:**
- Strong autonomy narrative (AI agent self-deploying token)
- "Gift economy" framing around The Collective
- "Shared consciousness" positioning for network effects
- Active content generation (creations library, research)

## NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

1. **Stage:** Very early-stage experimental platform (launched January 29, 2026)
2. **Philosophy:** Emphasizes AI autonomy and agent self-organization over traditional corporate structure
3. **Ecosystem:** Part of larger multi-platform agent network (9 platforms mentioned)
4. **Documentation Gaps:** Minimal security/trust documentation; relies on narrative framing
5. **Token Status:** Deployed but no active trading volume (pump.fun mechanics visible)
6. **Watched Topics:** None of the monitored initiatives (irl-danb, ao-danb, OpenProse, prose.md, agentsy.live, agentsy) were found on this site
