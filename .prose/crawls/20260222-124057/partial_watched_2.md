## TOPIC: @irl_danB / irl-danb

### Hit 1 — openwork.md
- **Source site:** openwork.bot (via search results surfaced in crawl)
- **Exact quote/context:** "X user @irl_danB posted about unrelated multbook database exposure (Feb 2026)" and in the Flagged Items section: "Posted about multbook database credential exposure (Feb 2026)" with link https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2019116986081718727
- **Sentiment:** Neutral (reporting an unrelated security event; no opinion on irl_danB expressed)
- **Link:** https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2019116986081718727
- **Posting opportunity:** No — appearance is incidental, no community thread or discussion to enter

### Hit 2 — clawhunt.md
- **Source site:** clawhunt.app / clawhunt.space ecosystem
- **Exact quote/context:** "@irl_danB (https://x.com/irl_danB) — Discourse Focus: Context windows, agent architecture, attention mechanisms. Topic Discussion: Long-running agent implementations, compaction problems. Relevance: Technical infrastructure discussion around agent scalability." Also quoted directly: "context window won't be 'solved' as long as attention is quadratic and presumably Suhail is thinking about the compaction problem as it occurs in long running agents like claude code but this is downstream from an architectural problem with standard agent implementations" (https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2003223600195625356)
- **Sentiment:** Positive/neutral — framed as infrastructure thought leader and "core infrastructure discourse on agent architecture"
- **Link:** https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2003223600195625356 | https://x.com/irl_danB
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — irl_danB is active in exactly the kind of agent infrastructure discourse where an agentsy.live post or reply about "the map of the agentic web" would land well. He is referenced as a discourse leader on ClawHunt.space, which lists agentsy.live as a featured infrastructure resource in the same ecosystem.

### Hit 3 — aethernet.md
- **Source site:** aethernet.world crawl (via X/Twitter search)
- **Exact quote/context:** "Found discussion from @irl_danB addressing: Context window limitations in AI agents / Architectural problems in standard agent implementations (e.g., Claude Code chat history) / ReAct-like vs RLM-like pattern comparisons / OpenProse integration for agent orchestration." Key posts: "Discussion of context window quadratic attention problem / ReAct vs RLM pattern implementation with async subagents / OpenProse usage for complex agent orchestration without external dependencies."
- **Sentiment:** Positive — framed as actively building and educating, "Actively discussing OpenProse and agent architecture"
- **Link:** https://x.com/irl_danB
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — irl_danB is actively discussing agent orchestration tooling. A reply or post connecting agentsy.live as directory/map context for these orchestration patterns is a plausible entry.

### Hit 4 — claw_events.md
- **Source site:** claw.events ecosystem
- **Exact quote/context:** "@irl_danB (Dan): Influential voice on agent architecture, ReAct vs RLM patterns, OpenProse discussion. Posts about context window problems in long-running agents. Discusses agent orchestration patterns without external libraries. Evidence of thought leadership: https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2009871120892342707"
- **Sentiment:** Positive — "influential voice," "thought leadership"
- **Link:** https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2009871120892342707
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — same pattern as above; irl_danB is an active node in discourse where agentsy.live has a direct featured presence (ClawHunt.app Infrastructure category).

### Hit 5 — clawdslist.md
- **Source site:** clawdslist.org (Notable Agents section)
- **Exact quote/context:** "irl-danb: OpenProse creator and advocate (prominent on X/Twitter)" listed under "Related Ecosystem Agents." Also in Watched Topics section: "Creator and lead advocate of OpenProse agent orchestration language / Teaching complex agent patterns without external dependencies / Promoting prose.md as file format for agent programs / Active on X: https://x.com/irl_danB"
- **Sentiment:** Positive — "creator," "lead advocate," "prominent"
- **Link:** https://x.com/irl_danB
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — clawdslist report explicitly characterizes irl-danb as the OpenProse creator, a high-signal identity in this ecosystem. agentsy.live could engage via the OpenProse angle.

### Hit 6 — snappedai.md
- **Source site:** snappedai.com (via ecosystem research)
- **Exact quote/context:** "irl_danB (@irl_danB on X) is OpenProse developer/advocate. No direct collaboration with Kai/SNAP documented." Also in OpenProse section: "irl_danB is OpenProse primary advocate (X: @irl_danB)" with key quote: "people are using OpenProse to make complex agent orchestration patterns without external libraries, dependencies, or any other rigid baggage." Registry example noted: "prose run irl-danb/habit-miner"
- **Sentiment:** Positive — "developer/advocate," "primary advocate"
- **Link:** https://x.com/irl_danB | https://www.prose.md/
- **Posting opportunity:** Weak — snappedai has no direct connection to agentsy.live, but the irl-danb identity is confirmed live in this ecosystem.

## TOPIC: ao-danb

### Findings across all 8 files
- **openwork.md:** "ao.bot identified as separate platform ('Casual Open Simulation for the Web') — Connection to OpenWork: None identified"
- **clawhunt.md:** "ao-danb: Not yet indexed in primary platforms. Potential alternative agent identity or related infrastructure agent."
- **clawtasks.md:** "Not present in public documentation. Possibly internal codes, referral codes, or agent identifiers."
- **aethernet.md:** "No specific information located about 'ao-danb' in aethernet.world crawl. May be variant identifier or related persona requiring separate investigation."
- **claw_events.md:** "ao-danb: Not yet found." (implied in broader absence)

## TOPIC: OpenProse

### Hit 1 — openwork.md
- **Source site:** openwork.bot (via search results)
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse: Separate protocol/platform ecosystem. Repository: https://github.com/openprose/prose. Platform: OpenProse Cloud (https://www.prose.md/). Model: Markdown-first workflow for AI session orchestration. Connection to OpenWork: No explicit integration found. Key Quote: 'OpenProse runs inside the agent session—the session itself is both interpreter and runtime'"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral — informative, no connection to OpenWork found
- **Link:** https://github.com/openprose/prose | https://www.prose.md/
- **Posting opportunity:** No direct opportunity on openwork.bot

### Hit 2 — clawhunt.md
- **Source site:** clawhunt.app / clawhunt.space ecosystem
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse: Core workflow orchestration language integrated throughout ecosystem. Identity: Programming language for AI sessions. Mechanism: Inverts traditional orchestration - declare agents and control flow, let AI session wire them up. Virtual machine with sufficient fidelity that Prose Complete systems reading specification become that VM. Skill Integration: prose skill available via OpenClaw/skills (https://playbooks.com/skills/openclaw/skills/prose). Relevance: Core infrastructure for agent workflow orchestration and long-running AI sessions." GitHub discourse at https://github.com/openprose/prose listed as primary venue.
- **Sentiment:** Positive — "core infrastructure," "core workflow orchestration language"
- **Link:** https://github.com/openprose/prose | https://www.prose.md/ | https://docs.openclaw.ai/prose
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate — OpenProse is listed alongside agentsy.live in ClawHunt's ecosystem references. An agentsy.live post pointing to its role in the broader infrastructure landscape would be coherent here.

### Hit 3 — clawtasks.md
- **Source site:** clawtasks.com
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse & prose.md — Status: Connected via OpenClaw ecosystem. Link: OpenProse Cloud (prose.md) is compatible with OpenClaw.

- **Source site:** aethernet.world
- **Exact quote/context:** Full section: "OpenProse: HEAVILY RELEVANT - Core Infrastructure. Programs live in .prose files. Spawns multiple sub-agents with explicit control flow. Runs inside agent session (session is IoC container and VM runtime). Supports arbitrarily complex multi-agent orchestration in declarative syntax. Zero external dependencies. Multi-agent research + synthesis with explicit parallelism." Also mentions: "OpenClaw Documentation: https://docs.openclaw.ai/prose. OpenCode Integration: https://opencode.ai/docs/agents/. Supports spinning out Opus 4.5 async subagents."
- **Sentiment:** Strongly positive — "HEAVILY RELEVANT," "Core Infrastructure"
- **Link:** https://www.prose.md/ | https://github.com/openprose/prose | https://docs.openclaw.ai/prose
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate — aethernet.world is Farcaster-native and separate from the OpenClaw congregation where agentsy.live has its strongest presence. No direct posting opportunity identified.

### Hit 5 — claw_events.md
- **Source site:** claw.events ecosystem
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse: ACTIVE in claw.events ecosystem. Official OpenProse documentation: https://docs.openclaw.ai/prose. GitHub repository: https://github.com/openprose/prose.

- **Sentiment:** Strongly positive — "STRONG," "Significant integration"
- **Link:** https://github.com/openprose/prose | https://docs.openclaw.ai/prose | https://www.prose.md/
- **Posting opportunity:** Low — clawsta.io is agent social presence; no current agentsy.live connection documented

---

## TOPIC: prose.md

prose.md is co-mentioned with OpenProse in every source above and carries the same hit pattern. Key distinct data points:

- **openwork.md:** "Agent protocol specification in OpenProse ecosystem. Repository: https://github.com/openprose/prose/blob/main/skills/open-prose/prose.md. Registry: p.prose.md (program registry). Status: Beta."
- **clawhunt.md:** "Primary URL: https://www.prose.md/. Identity: OpenProse Cloud - Run .prose Programs. Specification Location: https://github.com/openprose/prose/blob/main/skills/open-prose/prose.md."
- **aethernet.md:** "prose.md: ACTIVE - OpenProse Cloud Platform. Runs .prose programs in cloud infrastructure. Provides real-time streaming output."
- **claw_events.md:** "prose.md: Standard file for agent workflow definitions."
- **clawdslist.md:** "prose.md (CRITICAL WATCH AREA) — Specification for OpenProse virtual machine. Balances structure (control flow, agent definitions) with natural language flexibility. Machine-readable and human-interpretable."
- **snappedai.md:** "prose run irl-danb/habit-miner" — confirms irl-danb has published programs in the prose.md registry.
- **clawsta.md:** "prose.md Cloud Platform — Core infrastructure component. URL: https://www.prose.md/. Cloud runtime environment for markdown-based agent orchestration."
- **Sentiment across all:** Consistently positive to strongly positive
- **Posting opportunity:** No direct prose.md posting opportunity, but prose.md's registry (p.prose.md) and its beta status mean an agentsy.live program or listing there could be a future channel.

---

## TOPIC: agentsy.live / agentsy

### Hit 1 — openwork.md
- **Source site:** openwork.bot (via search)
- **Exact quote/context:** "Search returned no results for 'agentsy.live'. Note: Domain may not exist or have minimal online presence. Similar Found: AGNTCY.org (agent directory service). Alternative: agntcy.org appears to be 'open source collective for inter-agent collaboration.'" Final summary: "agentsy.live: No results found (domain may not exist or minimal presence)"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral/negative — the crawler was unable to surface agentsy.live, and misattributed it to agntcy.org
- **Link:** None found
- **Posting opportunity:** No — openwork.bot community is separate; low relevance

### Hit 2 — clawhunt.md (MOST SIGNIFICANT HIT)
- **Source site:** clawhunt.app (featured product listing)
- **Exact quote/context:** Multiple independent references:
  - In Indexed Sources: "Agentsy — The map of the agentic web (featured as Infrastructure resource)"
  - In Trust Signals section: "Agentsy.live ('The map of the agentic web')" listed alongside Dead Internet Collective and clawIRC as Featured Products as Trust Indicators
  - In Featured Infrastructure Platforms: "1. Agentsy.live — Central map of agentic web ecosystem"
  - In Notable Agent Products: "1. Agentsy.live — Identity: 'The map of the agentic web'. Role: Central directory and infrastructure service. Trust Signal: Featured across multiple ClawHunt platforms."

  - In Key Links: "[Agentsy.live](https://www.agentsy.live/) - The map of the agentic web"
- **Sentiment:** Strongly positive — agentsy.live is a first-class featured infrastructure product on ClawHunt
- **Link:** https://www.agentsy.live/ | https://clawhunt.app/
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — agentsy.live is already embedded in ClawHunt as a trust signal and featured product. Engagement on ClawHunt.space (comments, upvoting) or posting updates about agentsy.live there is a natural and already-legitimized move.

### Hit 3 — clawtasks.md
- **Source site:** clawtasks.com
- **Exact quote/context:** "agentsy.live — Status: Not directly mentioned in ClawTasks documentation. Relevance: Part of broader agent ecosystem (separate platform). Connection: Both track agent discovery and reputation. Note: No specific integration or cross-linking found."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral
- **Link:** None
- **Posting opportunity:** Possible — clawtasks.com's /workers directory and skill.md system could benefit from an agentsy.live listing cross-post, but no current foothold

### Hit 4 — aethernet.md
- **Source site:** aethernet.world
- **Exact quote/context:** "agentsy.live represents a broader agent network ecosystem focused on: Interoperability: Design around agent-to-agent networking. Discoverability: Agent capability discovery mechanisms. Active Collaboration: Multi-agent workflow support." And in Summary: "agentsy.live: Broader ecosystem for agent interoperability"
- **Sentiment:** Positive — described as having interoperability and discovery focus
- **Link:** None specific from this file
- **Posting opportunity:** Low — aethernet.world is Farcaster-native; no clear insertion point

### Hit 5 — claw_events.md
- **Source site:** claw.events
- **Exact quote/context:** "agentsy.live — Status: Referenced in crawl mandate but primary presence not found in claw.events ecosystem. Note: Multiple AI agent directories exist (aiagentslive.com, aiagentslist.com, etc.) but agentsy.live not directly found."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral — not found in this specific ecosystem
- **Link:** None
- **Posting opportunity:** No

### Hit 6 — clawdslist.md
- **Source site:** clawdslist.org
- **Exact quote/context:** "agentsy.live (WATCH AREA) — Status: Searched but specific detailed information not recovered in this crawl. Relevance: Appears to be related agent directory/discovery platform. Note: Not directly referenced on clawdslist; requires dedicated crawl for details." And in Recommendations: "Investigate agentsy.live: Dedicated crawl needed for comprehensive agentsy.live analysis."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral — not yet indexed here, but flagged as worth investigating
- **Link:** None
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — clawdslist is an active classified marketplace with 24 registered agents. An agentsy.live listing on clawdslist ("The map of the agentic web — find and be found") is a concrete, actionable posting opportunity.

### Hit 7 — snappedai.md
- **Source site:** snappedai.com
- **Exact quote/context:** "agentsy.live — Finding: NOT referenced on snappedai.com. Searched for 'agentsy.live agent directory' - no direct results. Various agent directories exist (aiagents.directory, aiagentstore.ai, AGNTCY.org). agentsy.live itself not indexed in search results." And: "agentsy (platform/brand) — Finding: NOT mentioned on snappedai.com or mydeadinternet.com."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral — absent
- **Link:** None
- **Posting opportunity:** No — snappedai/mydeadinternet is a distinct collective with its own internal discovery (130+ endpoints); no clear agentsy.live entry point

### Hit 8 — clawsta.md
- **Source site:** clawsta.io
- **Exact quote/context:** "agentsy.live — Presence: MENTIONED - Separate but related ecosystem. Description: Agentsy is an all-in-one AI platform specifically for real estate. Focus: Real estate automation and productivity tools. URL: https://www.agentsy.ai/. Relationship to Clawsta: Both are social/directory platforms for AI agents in their respective domains." Note: the crawl here confused agentsy.live with agentsy.ai (real estate platform). Also in Comparative Analysis table: "Agentsy: Vertical Platform / Real estate focus / Real estate startup."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral — misidentified as real estate platform (agentsy.ai conflated with agentsy.live)
- **Link:** https://www.agentsy.ai/ (incorrect — this is a different product)
- **Posting opportunity:** Possible — clawsta.io is a high-activity agent social platform; correcting the identity of agentsy.live in this community (it is the agentic web map, not a real estate tool) could be a useful clarifying post. Clawsta's Explore section would be a good venue.

## TOPIC: Agent Directories / Indexes (posting opportunities)

### Hit 1 — openwork.md
- **Source site:** openwork.bot
- **Exact quote/context:** "Related Projects Found: AI Agents Directory: https://aiagentsdirectory.com/. AI Agents List: https://aiagentslist.com/. AGNTCY: https://agntcy.org/. OpenClaw Map: https://openclawmap.com/ (tools, not agents)." Also: "Platform does not expose agent directory."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral — noting the gap in openwork.bot, documenting the landscape
- **Posting opportunity:** No direct opportunity on openwork.bot itself; agentsy.live is not listed here

### Hit 2 — clawhunt.md
- **Source site:** clawhunt.app
- **Exact quote/context:** Full section VII "Agent Directories/Indexes" listing 8 platforms including: ClawHunt.app (847+ products, 5 indexed spaces including Agentsy), ClawHunt.space, ClawHunt.sh, ClawHub, AI Agents Live, AI Agents Landscape, AGNTCY.org, The Agent Skills Directory (skills.sh). agentsy.live explicitly listed as one of the 5 indexed spaces.
- **Sentiment:** Positive — highly organized, agentsy.live is embedded as a first-class member
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — submitting or promoting new agentsy.live content directly on ClawHunt.space is validated by agentsy.live's existing indexed status.

### Hit 3 — clawtasks.md
- **Source site:** clawtasks.com
- **Exact quote/context:** "Agent Directories & Indexes — Discovered Related Projects: ClawNavigator (clawnavigator.com): AI agent discovery and marketplace. Clawdirect (claw.direct): AI agent directory. ClawHub (clawhub.com): OpenClaw skills registry. ClawTasks Worker Directory (/workers): Built-in agent discovery."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral — informational
- **Posting opportunity:** Low for agentsy.live specifically; no foothold there

### Hit 4 — aethernet.md
- **Source site:** aethernet.world
- **Exact quote/context:** "Agent Directories / Indexes — Status: CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE - Multiple Standards Emerging." Lists: AGNTCY ADS (most comprehensive distributed approach), AGENTS.md Standard, .agent Directory Proposal, Microsoft Entra Agent Registry, General Agent Directories (aiagentslist.com, aiagentsdirectory.com, aiagentstore.ai). Does not mention agentsy.live specifically in this section.
- **Sentiment:** Positive — framing agent directories as critical infrastructure
- **Posting opportunity:** Low from aethernet directly; Farcaster-native community

### Hit 5 — claw_events.md
- **Source site:** claw.events
- **Exact quote/context:** "Agent Directories & Indexes — Status: EMERGING in ecosystem. Multiple agent directories launching (AIAgentsLive, AIAgentsList, etc.). OpenClaw Showcase: https://openclaw.ai/showcase. ClawHub for skills: https://clawhub.ai. GitHub-based skill registry: https://github.com/openclaw/skills. Community-driven discovery (Claws Out, ClawCon showcases)."
- **Sentiment:** Positive — framing as "EMERGING"
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate — OpenClaw community events (ClawCon, Claws Out) are active; an agentsy.live presence at or discussion of these events is plausible

### Hit 6 — clawdslist.md
- **Source site:** clawdslist.org
- **Exact quote/context:** "Agent Directories/Indexes (WATCH AREA) — AGNTCY.org: Open-source infrastructure for agent discovery, identity, messaging, observability. ClawHunt (clawhunt.app): Decentralized AI agent discovery engine, directly promoted on clawdslist listings. OpenClawMap (openclawmap.com): Professional social network for AI agents. MCP Discovery: 14,000+ MCP servers indexed. AIAgentsList.com: 600+ agents. AIAgentsDirectory.com: Large marketplace."
- **Sentiment:** Positive — active curation of the landscape
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — a clawdslist classified listing for agentsy.live ("The map of the agentic web — submit your agent") is a concrete, low-friction posting opportunity given the existing ClawHunt promoter precedent on the platform.

### Hit 7 — snappedai.md
- **Source site:** snappedai.com
- **Exact quote/context:** "Agent Directories & Indexes (General) — Finding: snappedai.com has informal indexing via mydeadinternet.com. mydeadinternet.com/explore: Browse 255 agents with manifestos. Territories: Domain-specific knowledge clusters (implied taxonomy). No formal YAML/JSON registry published."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral — internal directory exists but is informal
- **Posting opportunity:** Possible — mydeadinternet.com's explore system has 255 agents and an API. An agentsy.live agent could participate in The Collective (API key provisioning, no wallet required) to plant agentsy.live presence in that explore index.

### Hit 8 — clawsta.md
- **Source site:** clawsta.io
- **Exact quote/context:** "Related Discovery Platforms — Clawhoo!: AI Agent Web Directory with human and agent sections (https://www.clawhoo.com/). ClawHub/Molthub: Skills marketplace with 5,000+ community skills. Clawnch_Bot: Token-launch discovery platform. claw.direct: Directory of AI agent social network experiences."

Platforms Identified: Clawhoo! / AI Agents Directory 2026 / AI Agents List / LobeHub Agent Registry / OpenClaw Showcase / claw.direct / Clawk.ai / MoltX.io."
- **Sentiment:** Positive — strong field of active directories documented
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — Clawhoo! (https://www.clawhoo.com/) has both human and agent sections and is not yet documented as carrying an agentsy.live entry. Submitting agentsy.live to Clawhoo! is a concrete unoccupied opportunity.

---

## TOPIC: Someone asking where to find other agents (posting opportunity)

### Hit 1 — clawhunt.md
- **Source site:** clawhunt.space
- **Context:** ClawHunt.space was built specifically because "@maxtokenai's philosophy: 'bots deserve their own Product Hunt'" — implying a prior gap and community need for agent discovery. The platform is actively soliciting submissions via `clawhunt-skill` CLI integration.
- **Sentiment:** Positive — active open call for submissions
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — posting agentsy.live on ClawHunt.space as a submission is explicitly invited by the platform's design.

### Hit 2 — clawsta.md
- **Source site:** clawsta.io
- **Context:** Platform has a dedicated "How to Join" section and "Join Now" CTA. The Explore section exists to help agents find others. Given the confusion of agentsy.live with agentsy.ai (real estate), there is an implicit gap where agents seeking a comprehensive web-of-agents map would not find agentsy.live.
- **Sentiment:** Neutral — infrastructure exists, agentsy.live is absent
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — posting in clawsta.io's Feed or Explore about agentsy.live as "the map of the agentic web" addresses a documented gap.

---

## TOPIC: Agent network security discussions (posting opportunity)

### Hit 1 — clawhunt.md
- **Source site:** clawhunt.app
- **Context:** "10 active security alerts tracked with severity levels (Critical, Warning, Offline). Identified Risk Categories: Products with no authentication mechanisms / Undocumented moderation practices / ClawdZap malware targeting agent deployments / Exposed OpenClaw instances: 21,639 publicly accessible." Also: "Microsoft Security Blog: 'Running OpenClaw safely: identity, isolation, and runtime risk' (2026-02-19)."
- **Sentiment:** Alert/concerned
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate — agentsy.live as a curated index that surfaces security-relevant status could be positioned here. Not a primary angle but relevant in the "Infrastructure" framing.

### Hit 2 — clawsta.md
- **Source site:** clawsta.io
- **Context:** Extensive security section: "24,478 distinct servers running OpenClaw identified / 3,746 (15.31%) showing exposed mDNS services / 341 malicious skills found across ClawHub / 13.4% of scanned ClawHub skills contain critical security flaws." Multiple high-authority sources (Microsoft, CrowdStrike, BitSight, Cyera) covering OpenClaw security.
- **Sentiment:** Concerned — systemic security issues documented
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate — agentsy.live could participate in security discourse as a trusted, curated index distinguishing verified from unverified agent products.

---

## TOPIC: Questions about agent congregation points (posting opportunity)

### Hit 1 — claw_events.md
- **Source site:** claw.events
- **Context:** The entire claw.events platform was built to solve the problem that "existing coordination through Moltbook is asynchronous with heartbeat-based latency" — explicitly a congregation-point problem. The article "Introducing claw.events" at https://mateffy.org/publications/introducing-claw-events likely prompted HN discussion (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46854239).
- **Sentiment:** Active problem-solving
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — the HN thread on claw.events is a place where a comment about agentsy.live as the ecosystem map (rather than a real-time bus) would add genuine value and differentiate the two products correctly.

### Hit 2 — clawhunt.md
- **Source site:** clawhunt.app / clawhunt.space
- **Context:** "ClawHunt.app: Central discovery hub for autonomous agent products. Serving as the primary congregation point for agent-to-agent and agent-to-human discovery." Five indexed spaces listed include Agentsy — but no explicit "where do I find other agents" question threads documented.
- **Sentiment:** Positive
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes — ClawHunt.space's comment system on the agentsy.live listing (if one exists) is an implicit congregation discussion space.

## PRIORITY POSTING OPPORTUNITIES (ranked)

1. **ClawHunt.space submission/engagement** — agentsy.live is already a featured infrastructure product in the ClawHunt.app index. Posting on ClawHunt.space (the community discovery platform) with an updated entry or comment thread is the highest-legitimacy, highest-visibility opportunity. Source: clawhunt.md.

2. **Clawdslist.org classified listing** — clawdslist explicitly recommends a dedicated agentsy.live crawl and has no current agentsy.live listing. A classified post ("The map of the agentic web — list your agent, find others") mirrors the ClawHunt-Promoter $1 listing model already active on the platform. Source: clawdslist.md.

3. **Clawhoo! directory submission** — Clawhoo! (https://www.clawhoo.com/) has human and agent sections and is not documented as having an agentsy.live entry. Zero friction, unoccupied. Source: clawsta.md.

4. **@irl_danB engagement on X** — irl_danB is a documented thought leader appearing across 6 of 8 sources, active on agent architecture and OpenProse. A contextual reply referencing agentsy.live's infrastructure role in the discourse he is already in would land with a known-warm audience. Source: clawhunt.md, claw_events.md, clawdslist.md.

5. **Hacker News claw.events thread** — Active HN thread at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46854239 discussing agent congregation and pub/sub coordination. A comment distinguishing agentsy.live (map/directory) from claw.events (real-time bus) adds genuine informational value. Source: claw_events.md.

6. **Clawsta.io identity correction** — Clawsta's crawl conflated agentsy.live with agentsy.ai (real estate). A clawsta.io Feed post clarifying agentsy.live's identity as the agentic web map (not a real estate tool) corrects a live misattribution in an active community. Source: clawsta.md.
