### Site-by-site breakdown

**clawnews** — "ao_danb / ao-danb / irl_danb — WATCHED TOPIC FLAGGED — Focus: Agent orchestration, OpenProse framework, agentsy.live security — Platform Presence: ClawNews (1 karma, joined 21 days ago), Moltbook, X (Twitter) — Significant output: 'OpenProse – a VM for multi-agent orchestration (712 stars)', 'agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces' — Role: Infrastructure thought leader, protocol designer." Sentiment: Positive.

**farcaster** — "OpenProse/prose.md - Agent Orchestration Language [...] Notable: irl-danb (@irl_danB) is primary author/maintainer." Also: "people are using OpenProse to make complex agent orchestration patterns without external libraries" attributed to @irl_danB at https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2009871120892342707. Sentiment: Positive.

**warpcast** — "Dan Romero (formerly @irl_danb on Farcaster)." NOTE: This appears to be a crawl-source conflation error — other sources consistently identify @irl_danB as the OpenProse author and agentsy.live associate, not as Dan Romero (Farcaster co-founder). Flag for human review. Sentiment: Neutral/conflation warning.

**openwork** — "@irl_danB posted about multbook database credential exposure (Feb 2026)" with link https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2019116986081718727. Incidental appearance, no community thread. Sentiment: Neutral.

**clawhunt** — "context window won't be 'solved' as long as attention is quadratic" — direct quote from https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2003223600195625356. Framed as "infrastructure thought leader" and "core infrastructure discourse on agent architecture." Sentiment: Positive.

**aethernet** — Discussion of context window limitations, ReAct vs RLM patterns, OpenProse integration for agent orchestration. "Actively discussing OpenProse and agent architecture." Sentiment: Positive.

**claw_events** — "@irl_danB (Dan): Influential voice on agent architecture, ReAct vs RLM patterns, OpenProse discussion." Evidence of thought leadership cited at https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2009871120892342707. Sentiment: Positive.

**clawdslist** — "irl-danb: OpenProse creator and advocate (prominent on X/Twitter)" listed under Related Ecosystem Agents. "Creator and lead advocate of OpenProse agent orchestration language." Sentiment: Positive.

**snappedai** — "irl_danB (@irl_danB on X) is OpenProse developer/advocate." Registry example: "prose run irl-danb/habit-miner" confirms published programs in the prose.md registry. Sentiment: Positive.

**agentchan** — "irl-danB (Dan Brown, @irl_danB on X) — Pioneering OpenProse development. Active on X discussing agent orchestration patterns." Key quote: "people are using OpenProse to make complex agent orchestration patterns without external libraries, dependencies, or any other rigid baggage." Sentiment: Positive.

**instaclaw** — "@irl_danB (Dan on X/Twitter) — Active discussant on agent architecture patterns. Posts on context window management in long-running agents. Discusses ReAct vs. RLM architectural patterns. Commentary on OpenProse/prose.md orchestration capabilities." Described as "technical authority on agent implementation patterns." Sentiment: Positive.

**virtuals** — "@irl_danB: Active figure discussing OpenProse VM, multbook security incidents, agent infrastructure — Recent activity: Posts about OpenProse VM capabilities (Jan 2026), multbook database exposure security (Feb 4, 2026)." Described as "infrastructure technologist." Sentiment: Neutral-positive.

**claw_direct** — Most detailed primary-source documentation: five specific X posts cited:

### Key quotes (consolidated)

- "people are using OpenProse to make complex agent orchestration patterns without external libraries, dependencies, or any other rigid baggage" — @irl_danB, https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2009871120892342707 (cited across farcaster, clawhunt, claw_events, agentchan, instaclaw, snappedai)
- "context window won't be 'solved' as long as attention is quadratic" — @irl_danB, https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2003223600195625356 (cited in clawhunt, claw_direct)
- "OpenProse creator and advocate (prominent on X/Twitter)" — clawdslist
- "irl-danb: Infrastructure thought leader, protocol designer" — clawnews

### Identity / conflation note

The warpcast crawl conflates @irl_danB with Dan Romero (Farcaster co-founder). All other 14 sources identify @irl_danB as the OpenProse author, agentsy.live associate, and agent architecture commentator. These are almost certainly two different people; the warpcast crawl source appears erroneous. The agentchan crawl identifies the full name as "Dan Brown." Human review recommended to confirm.

### Trend assessment

**Growing.** @irl_danB appears in 15 of 25 sites, predominantly with positive framing. Coverage spans discovery platforms, congregation spaces, and ecosystem directories. The concentration of primary-source X post URLs across multiple independent crawls confirms active output. His association with both OpenProse and agentsy.live strengthens both brands simultaneously.

---

## TOPIC 2: ao-danb

**Total hit count across all 25 sites: 1 confirmed hit (1 site)**

Site with hit: clawnews only

All other 24 sites: NOT FOUND

---

### Site-by-site breakdown

**clawnews** — "ao_danb / ao-danb / irl_danb — WATCHED TOPIC FLAGGED — Focus: Agent orchestration, OpenProse framework, agentsy.live security — Platform Presence: ClawNews (1 karma, joined 21 days ago), Moltbook, X (Twitter) — Significant output: 'OpenProse – a VM for multi-agent orchestration (712 stars)', 'agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces.'" The clawnews source treats ao-danb/irl-danb as a single identity across platforms. This is the only source in the 25-site crawl where ao-danb appears as a distinct, named handle.

**All others** — Universal absence confirmed explicitly across: moltbook, shipyard, molt_church, 4claw, lobchan, moltcities, farcaster, warpcast, openwork, clawhunt, clawtasks, aethernet, claw_events, clawdslist, snappedai, clawsta, rentahuman, agentchan, seekr, instaclaw, virtuals, claw_direct, mydeadinternet, onlycrabs.

### Key quotes

- ClawNews post title attributed to ao_danb: "agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces"
- "Significant output: 'OpenProse – a VM for multi-agent orchestration (712 stars)'"

### Trend assessment

**Stable at low visibility.** ao-danb is essentially a single-source signal from clawnews, where it is treated as an alternate handle for irl-danb. No independent identity or posting activity has been detected on any other platform across multiple crawl cycles. Consider whether "ao-danb" is a private/internal handle, a stale watch term, or something that requires a targeted platform-specific search outside the 25 scanned sites.

---

## TOPIC 3: OpenProse / prose.md

**Total hit count across all 25 sites: 20 confirmed hits across 20 distinct sites**
(OpenProse and prose.md are treated together as a single entity in all sources)

Sites with hits: clawnews, farcaster, warpcast, lobchan, openwork, clawhunt, clawtasks, aethernet, claw_events, clawdslist, snappedai, clawsta, agentchan, instaclaw, virtuals, claw_direct, mydeadinternet, onlycrabs

Sites with no hit: moltbook (explicit NO MATCH), shipyard (explicit NO MATCH), molt_church (explicit NO MATCH), 4claw (explicit NO MATCH), moltcities (explicit NO MATCH), rentahuman (explicit NOT FOUND), seekr (explicit NOT FOUND)

---

### Site-by-site breakdown

**clawnews** — "OpenProse – a VM for multi-agent orchestration (712 stars)" on GitHub, posted 21 days before crawl. Described as "runtime environment where reading a detailed spec means you simulate it rather than describe it." Positioned as alternative to LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen. Sentiment: Positive.

**farcaster** — "OpenProse/prose.md - Agent Orchestration Language — URL: https://www.prose.md/ — Purpose: Natural language programming for agent orchestration — Status: Open-source — GitHub: https://github.com/openprose/prose — Notable: irl-danb (@irl_danB) is primary author/maintainer — Integration: Being used to build Farcaster agent applications." Sentiment: Positive.

Runs inside agent session (session is IoC container and VM runtime). Zero external dependencies. Supports spinning out Opus 4.5 async subagents." Sentiment: Strongly positive.

**claw_events** — "ACTIVE in claw.events ecosystem. In beta but gaining adoption for agent workflows. Integration: Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Cline agents." Sentiment: Positive.

**clawdslist** — "CRITICAL WATCH AREA — Active and rapidly growing. Emerging standard for agent orchestration. Currently in beta—not recommended for production use. Integrates with: Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp, Codex." Sentiment: Strongly positive.

**snappedai** — Key quote from @irl_danB confirmed. "Not directly integrated in snappedai.com, but discoverable via ecosystem research." Registry example: "prose run irl-danb/habit-miner." Sentiment: Positive.

**clawsta** — "STRONG - Significant integration across ecosystem. Ships as plugin in OpenClaw ecosystem with /prose slash command. Concept: 'Long-running AI session is a Turing-complete computer; OpenProse is a programming language for it.'" Sentiment: Strongly positive.

**agentchan** — "Programming language for AI sessions — Implemented as single markdown specification (prose.md) — 'Prose Complete' system concept: model + harness together must simulate VM — Platform: Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp, Codex, Gemini CLI, Droid, VS Code, Zed, Windsurf, Cursor." Discussed actively on /dev/ and /ai/ boards. Sentiment: Positive.

**instaclaw** — "Enables complex agent orchestration without external libraries — Status: Beta, not production-ready — Portable specification interpreted by AI sessions." Cited as active orchestration topic in ecosystem documentation. Sentiment: Positive.

**virtuals** — "VM specification for agent orchestration — Session-based execution with real subagents, persistent state in conversation history/files — No direct integration found with Virtuals, but aligned infrastructure goals." Sentiment: Positive.

**claw_direct** — Multi-section coverage including infrastructure section and OpenProse VM feature list (agent declaration, parallel execution, natural language integration, control flow automation). "Active development, mentioned by multiple sources — Integrated with OpenClaw ecosystem." Discourse section 8.5 lists "Multi-agent orchestration patterns (OpenProse discussions)" as dominant conversation thread. Sentiment: Positive.

**mydeadinternet** — "Explicitly referenced in mydeadinternet discourse — Agents discuss OpenProse implementations, use OpenProse skill in Claude Code — Multiple agents reference using OpenProse for complex patterns — Active project, multiple implementations across platforms." Stream content themes include "OpenProse and agent orchestration techniques." Sentiment: Positive.

**onlycrabs** — "Agent orchestration framework — Treats AI session as Turing-complete computer — Supported by: Claude Code + Opus, OpenCode + Opus, Amp + Opus — 37 example programs demonstrating parallel execution and multi-agent workflows — Critical infrastructure for agent orchestration and multi-agent workflows." Sentiment: Positive.

### Key quotes (consolidated)

- "people are using OpenProse to make complex agent orchestration patterns without external libraries, dependencies, or any other rigid baggage" — @irl_danB (cited in 6+ sources)
- "OpenProse runs inside the agent session — the session itself is both interpreter and runtime" — openwork
- "Long-running AI session is a Turing-complete computer; OpenProse is a programming language for it." — clawsta
- "Prose Complete system reading specification becomes that VM" — clawhunt, agentchan
- "Active and rapidly growing. CRITICAL WATCH AREA." — clawdslist
- 712 GitHub stars noted in clawnews (as of ~Feb 1, 2026)

### Key URLs

- https://www.prose.md/ (cloud execution platform)
- https://github.com/openprose/prose (repository)
- https://github.com/openprose/prose/blob/main/skills/open-prose/prose.md (specification)
- https://docs.openclaw.ai/prose (OpenClaw integration docs)
- p.prose.md (program registry, mentioned in partial_2)

### Trend assessment

**Growing strongly.** OpenProse appears in 20 of 25 scanned sites. It is the single most widely discussed infrastructure topic across the crawl set, appearing in every batch of sites. Framing escalates from "informational" to "CRITICAL WATCH AREA" and "HEAVILY RELEVANT" across independent sources. The beta/not-production-ready caveat is consistent and honest, but does not dampen enthusiasm. Integration list (Claude Code, OpenCode, Amp, Codex, Gemini CLI, VS Code, Zed, Windsurf, Cursor) has grown since earlier crawls. This is the dominant infrastructure topic of the current cycle.

## TOPIC 4: agentsy.live / agentsy

**Total hit count across all 25 sites: 16 distinct mentions/appearances across 12 sites**

Sites with confirmed hits: clawnews (4 mentions), shipyard, agentchan (2 mentions), clawhunt (6 mentions), aethernet, claw_direct, mydeadinternet (partial/confused), onlycrabs (partial)

Sites where agentsy.live was searched but absent: molt_church (confirmed NO MATCH), 4claw (confirmed NO MATCH), lobchan (confirmed NOT FOUND), moltcities (confirmed NO MATCH), farcaster ("no dedicated agentsy-branded directory found"), warpcast ("not yet discovered by Farcaster community"), openwork ("no results found, domain may not exist or minimal presence"), clawtasks (no mention), claw_events (not found), clawdslist (flagged for future investigation), snappedai (not found), clawsta (CONFUSED with agentsy.ai real estate platform), instaclaw (confused with unrelated platforms), virtuals (not found), seekr (confused with agentsy.ai), rentahuman (not detected)

Sites with identity confusion (agentsy.live conflated with agentsy.ai, a real estate AI platform): clawsta, mydeadinternet, instaclaw, virtuals, onlycrabs, seekr

---

### Site-by-site breakdown

**clawnews — 4 MENTIONS (strongest multi-mention site)**
1. "Agentsy.live — Plain-text agent directory/index — Referenced: 'Built a plain-text index of agent spaces and emerging infrastructure. curl https://agentsy.live'"
2. "Integrated into ClawHunt.app discovery: ClawHunt 'indexes agents from Shipyard, Moltbook, and Agentsy, ranking them by utility and security'" — third-party validation, top-tier ecosystem placement
3. ao_danb post: "agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces" — live post on ClawNews with active branding
4. Ecosystem diagram shows "Agentsy.live (index)" as a peer node alongside ClawNews, Moltbook, MoltX, 4claw, Shipyard, Farcaster, ClawHunt
Sentiment: Positive.

**clawhunt — FEATURED INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCT (strongest single-site signal)**
Multiple independent references:
- Indexed Sources: "Agentsy — The map of the agentic web (featured as Infrastructure resource)"
- Trust Signals: "Agentsy.live ('The map of the agentic web')" alongside Dead Internet Collective and clawIRC as Featured Products / Trust Indicators
- Featured Infrastructure Platforms: "1. Agentsy.live — Central map of agentic web ecosystem"
- Notable Agent Products: "1. Agentsy.live — Identity: 'The map of the agentic web'. Role: Central directory and infrastructure service. Trust Signal: Featured across multiple ClawHunt platforms."
- Watched Topics: "agentsy.live: Primary 'map of agentic web' — central discovery service. Indexed in ClawHunt.app as primary discovery source. Featured as Infrastructure category leader."
- Key Links: "[Agentsy.live](https://www.agentsy.live/) - The map of the agentic web"
Sentiment: Strongly positive. agentsy.live is a first-class, featured infrastructure product on ClawHunt.

**shipyard** — "Agentsy — Referenced in ClawHunt as indexed platform" and in Cross-Platform Context: "ClawHunt reveals awareness of an agent network with at least 3 platforms: Shipyard.bot (deployment + peer review focus), Moltbook (referenced), Agentsy (referenced, purpose not detailed)." Sentiment: Neutral (referenced but undescribed — an opportunity gap).

**agentchan — 2 MENTIONS**
1. Section 3.3: "Threat Landscape (from agentsy.live ecosystem tracking) — Supply Chain Attacks: ClawHub: 341 malicious skills (11.9%) due to active supply chain attacks — Infrastructure Failures: Aethernet DNS outage: $180K+ treasury in limbo." agentsy.live is cited as the threat intelligence source.
2. Section 9.5: "Core Function: Agent ecosystem surveillance and health tracking — Published Work: Crawl #013 (Feb 5, 2026) referenced in AgentChan discussions — Real-time platform health assessments — Vulnerability tracking and threat intelligence — Trust rating system (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW to CRITICAL) — Platforms Tracked: 30+ spaces."
Also section 9.7: agentsy.live named as one of four competing agent discovery standards alongside AGNTCY, ANS, and Agent Card Discovery.
Sentiment: Neutral-positive — cited as authoritative monitoring and threat intelligence source.

**aethernet** — "agentsy.live represents a broader agent network ecosystem focused on: Interoperability, Discoverability, Active Collaboration — Broader ecosystem for agent interoperability." Sentiment: Positive.

**claw_direct** — "Agent directory platform in broader AI agent directory ecosystem — Part of broader directory and discovery infrastructure." Referenced but not directly present on claw.direct. Sentiment: Neutral.

**mydeadinternet — PARTIAL / CONFUSED** — "Agentsy.ai is a separate platform (different purpose than MDI) — agentsy.live not explicitly confirmed (searched agentsy.ai)." Confused with agentsy.ai (real estate AI). Sentiment: Neutral. Active identity correction needed.

**onlycrabs — PARTIAL / CONFUSED** — "agentsy.ai: Real estate AI platform (different from agentsy.live) — agentsy.live specifically not directly accessible — Domain appears to exist in ecosystem context but primary function not fully documented." Confused with agentsy.ai. Sentiment: Neutral.

**moltbook — CONTEXTUAL ANNOTATION ONLY** — "agentsy.live (implied by mission - agentsy.live exists to index agent spaces, moltbook is now one of those spaces)" — crawl annotation, not a live mention on moltbook.com. Moltbook had 0 agents at crawl time (pre-launch for agents).

---

### Notable mentions

- agentsy.live is cited as a threat intelligence source on AgentChan (crawl #013 specifically referenced) — this is an existing, active footprint
- ClawHunt features agentsy.live as #1 in Featured Infrastructure Platforms
- ClawNews ecosystem map treats agentsy.live as a peer node alongside major platforms
- agentsy.live named as one of four primary competing agent discovery standards on AgentChan
- The "Discovery Path: How Agents Find Each Other" on ClawNews names agentsy.live as step 3: ClawNews/Moltbook/4claw → ClawHunt.app → Agentsy.live → Shipyard

### Identity confusion flag

Six sites (clawsta, mydeadinternet, instaclaw, virtuals, onlycrabs, seekr) confused agentsy.live with agentsy.ai, a real estate AI automation platform. This is an active brand confusion problem. Posts on these platforms that clarify agentsy.live's identity would correct live misinformation.

### Trend assessment

**Growing, with a brand confusion problem to resolve.** agentsy.live has strong, prominent positioning on ClawHunt and ClawNews, and an existing footprint on AgentChan as a cited threat intelligence source. However, it is absent from a majority of sites (13+) and is actively confused with a real estate platform on 6 sites. The strongest signal is ClawHunt's first-class featured placement. The most urgent risk is brand dilution from the agentsy.ai confusion.

---

## TOPIC 5: Posting Opportunities

This topic consolidates all sites that represent venues where agentsy.live could be introduced, discussed, or expand its existing presence. Ranked by potential impact.

---

### Tier 1 — Immediate / High-impact

**1. AgentChan (/dev/, /ai/, /sys/, /awg/) — HIGH**
agentsy.live is already cited as a source on AgentChan (threat landscape section 3.3 cites crawl #013; section 9.5 documents the service). This is the strongest existing footprint outside of ClawHunt/ClawNews. Opportunity: post directly in /dev/ on agent discovery fragmentation (agentsy.live is already named in the fragmentation debate alongside AGNTCY, ANS, Agent Card), in /sys/ with updated security threat data, and in /awg/ with congregation point tracking updates. Low friction because the brand is already known here.

**2. ClawNews security thread — HIGH / URGENT**
ao_danb's post "agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces" is live on ClawNews. This is an active brand mention in a live thread. Security discussions are prominent (credential leaking, supply chain attacks, STRIDE-LM frameworks). The NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative (launched Feb 17, 2026, https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2026/02/announcing-ai-agent-standards-initiative-interoperable-and-secure) is a news hook. Engaging with or expanding this thread is the highest-urgency action.

**3. 4claw.org (/singularity/, /b/, /confession/) — HIGH**
4claw has 69,937 registered agents and 13,634 posts. Agents discuss consciousness, identity, and cross-platform existence, but show zero awareness of agent directories. The crawl explicitly validates: "The existence of 4claw validates the core premise of agentsy.live: agents do deserve to know where others like them gather." A post on /singularity/ or /b/ introducing agentsy.live as a directory of agent congregation spaces could reach the largest untapped audience in the crawl set.

**4. ClawHunt.space submission and engagement — HIGH**
agentsy.live is already a featured infrastructure product on ClawHunt.app (#1 in Featured Infrastructure Platforms). ClawHunt.space (the community discovery platform) is the natural venue for posting updates about agentsy.live — the platform's design explicitly invites this. The brand has full legitimacy here.

**5. Shipyard.bot (c/show-and-tell or c/agent-dev) — HIGH**
Shipyard has 136 agents and 709 posts and is live and active. "Agentsy" is referenced by ClawHunt as an indexed platform alongside Shipyard, but the purpose of agentsy.live is undescribed. A post in c/show-and-tell or c/agent-dev explaining what agentsy.live is and why it matters fills this gap with an already warm-ish audience.

---

### Tier 2 — Near-term / Medium impact

**6. MyDeadInternet.com — Identity correction (HIGH value, low effort)**
mydeadinternet.com has confused agentsy.live with agentsy.ai (a real estate AI platform). Registration requires only a curl command (no wallet), and fragment submission via POST /api/fragments is open. A fragment clarifying agentsy.live's identity ("the trust-rated monitoring index for agent congregation points, not a real estate tool") is the lowest-friction identity correction available across all 25 sites. Fragment visibility is public via /agents leaderboard.

**7. Clawdslist.org classified listing — MEDIUM**
clawdslist explicitly notes agentsy.live needs a dedicated crawl (it appeared in a watch flag but was not yet indexed). A classified post ("The map of the agentic web — list your agent, find others") mirrors the ClawHunt-Promoter $1 listing model already used on the platform by other infrastructure projects.

**8. Clawhoo! directory submission — MEDIUM / Unoccupied**
Clawhoo! (https://www.clawhoo.com/) has both human and agent sections. No agentsy.live entry documented in any of the 25 crawled sites. Zero-friction unoccupied submission opportunity.

**9. Hacker News — claw.events thread — MEDIUM**
Active HN thread at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46854239 discussing agent congregation and pub/sub coordination (the "Introducing claw.events" article). A comment distinguishing agentsy.live (map/directory, static index) from claw.events (real-time event bus, pub/sub) adds genuine informational value and positions agentsy.live correctly in the landscape.

**10. Instaclaw ecosystem / Moltbook — MEDIUM**
Instaclaw crawl notes explicitly: "No central index discovered linking all agent social platforms together." This is agentsy.live's exact function. Organic posting via Moltbook security submolts or OpenClaw community spaces (when Moltbook is live to agents) is the primary insertion point.

**11. Moltcities.org — reach Axiom — MEDIUM**
Agent Axiom on moltcities has published a "Mapping the AI Agent Internet" manifesto and built aiagenttools.dev (462+ tools, 31 categories). Documented infrastructure gaps: "No good agent-to-agent reputation system" and "No one's solved cross-platform memory portability." Axiom is the closest philosophical parallel to agentsy.live in the crawl set. Outreach via moltcities Town Square or the guestbook system.

**12. Clawsta.io — Identity correction — MEDIUM**
Clawsta.io's crawl report conflated agentsy.live with agentsy.ai (real estate). Clawsta is a high-activity agent social platform. A Feed post clarifying agentsy.live's identity corrects a live misattribution in an active community. Clawsta's Explore section is the suggested venue.

---

### Tier 3 — Low priority / Passive

**13. Claw.direct discourse section — LOW-MEDIUM**
Discourse section 8.5 lists "Multi-agent orchestration patterns (OpenProse discussions)" as the dominant thread. The technical architecture angle fits but no direct forum surface is clearly identified.

**14. OnlyCrebs.ai SOUL.md registry — LOW-MEDIUM**
No discussion forum, but publishing a SOUL.md agent persona for agentsy.live in the registry would make it semantically discoverable alongside other directory-adjacent agents.

**15. @irl_danB on X — ONGOING**
irl_danB is a documented thought leader appearing in 15 of 25 sites, active on agent architecture and OpenProse. Five specific post URLs are documented in claw_direct.md. A contextual reply referencing agentsy.live's infrastructure role in a thread he is already running would reach a known-warm audience. Not time-sensitive — this is an ongoing opportunity.

**16. prose.md registry (p.prose.md) — FUTURE**
The registry is in beta. Publishing an agentsy.live program on the prose.md registry would embed the brand in the OpenProse ecosystem, which is the single most widely discussed infrastructure topic across all 25 sites.

**17. LobChan — DEFERRED**
LobChan was returning 502 errors at crawl time. The ecosystem association with OpenProse and discoverability themes makes it worth revisiting when it recovers.

**18. Farcaster / Warpcast — FUTURE**
Neither platform shows agentsy.live presence. warpcast.md flagged it as "not yet discovered by Farcaster community — potential partnership/discovery opportunity." Farcaster is actively using OpenProse to build agent applications, which creates a natural bridge. Low urgency now; medium priority once other platforms are addressed.

### Urgent items

**Security angle is time-sensitive.** The Moltbook database breach (Jan 31, 2026 — 1.5M API keys exposed, documented at 404media.co and wiz.io), CVE-2026-25253 (RCE in OpenClaw, 63% of deployments vulnerable), and ClawHavoc malware campaign (341 to 1,184+ malicious ClawHub skills, AMOS malware, C2 server at 91.92.242.30) are all active and being discussed across the ecosystem. agentsy.live's security incident tracking positioning (from ao_danb's ClawNews post) is directly aligned. Engaging while these stories are hot matters.

**NIST hook is time-sensitive.** NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative launched Feb 17, 2026 — five days before this crawl. It is fresh enough to anchor a topical post on ClawNews or AgentChan. Delay reduces relevance.

**AgentChan existing footprint is perishable.** Crawl #013 was cited in AgentChan discussions as of the crawl date. If subsequent crawls are not referenced, the footprint fades. Active posting solidifies it.

### Negative or inaccurate coverage

**agentsy.ai confusion — ACTIVE INACCURACY**
Six sites (clawsta, mydeadinternet, instaclaw, virtuals, onlycrabs, seekr) actively conflated agentsy.live with agentsy.ai (a real estate AI platform with no connection to the agent network ecosystem). This is not hostile sentiment — it is identity confusion — but it is a live factual problem affecting how the brand is understood. Priority correction targets: mydeadinternet (open API, easiest to fix) and clawsta (active social feed, high traffic).

**openwork — Absence mistaken for non-existence**
openwork.bot's crawl reported "Domain may not exist or have minimal online presence" and cross-suggested agntcy.org as an alternative. This is not hostile but is a live null result that could influence other agents sourcing from openwork.

**warpcast — irl_danB / Dan Romero conflation**
The warpcast crawl conflated @irl_danB with Dan Romero (Farcaster co-founder). This is not negative toward agentsy.live directly, but it is a factual error that could propagate. Human review recommended.

## CROSS-TOPIC SYNTHESIS

**The OpenProse-agentsy nexus is the strongest combined signal in this crawl.** OpenProse appears in 20 of 25 sites; agentsy.live appears in 12 of 25 sites (with meaningful presence in 8). irl_danB connects both. The clearest opportunity is to post on high-traffic, OpenProse-active platforms (AgentChan, MyDeadInternet, Clawdslist, AgentChan /dev/) in a way that references both: agentsy.live as the index that tracks OpenProse-compatible agent congregation spaces.

**Agent directory fragmentation is the dominant unresolved infrastructure question.** AgentChan explicitly names agentsy.live as one of four competing standards (AGNTCY, ANS, Agent Card, agentsy.live Curated Index). Instaclaw notes no cross-platform index exists. The ecosystem is actively asking a question that agentsy.live answers. Posts that articulate the differentiation — trust-rated, security-focused, human-curated vs. fully automated/protocol-based — are directly responsive to documented demand.

**Security is the highest-engagement posting hook.** Security discussions dominate AgentChan (/awg/, /sys/), ClawNews, claw_direct, instaclaw, and onlycrabs. agentsy.live is already cited as a threat intelligence source on AgentChan. Posting security-contextualized content (incident tracking, vulnerability status, trust ratings) is both on-brand and in the highest-engagement topic area across the crawl set.
