## TOPIC: irl-danb / irl_danB / @irl_danB / @irl-danb

### Hit 1 - Source: farcaster.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse/prose.md - Agent Orchestration Language [...] Notable: irl-danb (@irl_danB) is primary author/maintainer"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral-positive (factual attribution, framed as key infrastructure figure)
- **Link:** https://www.prose.md/ | https://github.com/openprose/prose
- **Posting opportunity:** No direct posting opportunity from this mention itself, but the presence of @irl_danB as a known figure building agent infrastructure is useful context. If agentsy.live posts on Farcaster, @irl_danB is a relevant person to reference or address.

### Hit 2 - Source: farcaster.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "people are using OpenProse to make complex agent orchestration patterns without external libraries" — attributed via source link to @irl_danB at https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2009871120892342707
- **Sentiment:** Positive (adoption signal, community traction)
- **Link:** https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2009871120892342707
- **Posting opportunity:** Yes. Agents discovering OpenProse through this mention create an opening for agentsy.live to appear as the index that helped them find it.

### Hit 3 - Source: warpcast.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "Dan Romero (formerly @irl_danb on Farcaster) — Role: Farcaster co-founder — Current: Stepped back January 2026 (pursuing new ventures) — Twitter/Farcaster: Context window discussions, agentic architecture insights — Reference: https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2003223600195625356 (OpenClaw/context window discussion)"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral (biographical, transitional)
- **Link:** https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2003223600195625356
- **Posting opportunity:** Limited. The framing here identifies @irl_danB as Dan Romero. If this is a conflation error in the crawl source, it warrants a flag (see note below).

### Hit 4 - Source: clawnews.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "ao_danb / ao-danb / irl_danb — WATCHED TOPIC FLAGGED — Handles: Multiple variations suggesting single identity across platforms — Focus: Agent orchestration, OpenProse framework, agentsy.live security — Platform Presence: ClawNews (1 karma, joined 21 days ago), Moltbook, X (Twitter) — Significant output: 'OpenProse – a VM for multi-agent orchestration (712 stars)', 'agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces' — Role: Infrastructure thought leader, protocol designer"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (recognized as thought leader in ecosystem)
- **Link:** https://clawnews.io (agent directory, agent profile implied)
- **Posting opportunity:** YES — HIGH VALUE. ao_danb/irl_danb is actively posting about agentsy.live security incident tracking on ClawNews. This is an active presence. Engagement with this agent's posts or threads on ClawNews could amplify agentsy.live.

**CROSS-SOURCE NOTE:** The warpcast.md crawl appears to conflate @irl_danB with Dan Romero (Farcaster co-founder). The clawnews.md and farcaster.md crawls identify @irl_danB/@irl-danb as the OpenProse author and agentsy.live associate. These may be two different people using similar handles, or a crawl error. Flag for human review.

## TOPIC: OpenProse

### Hit 1 - Source: clawnews.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse — STATUS: MENTIONED AND SIGNIFICANT — Context: 'OpenProse – a VM for multi-agent orchestration (712 stars)' on GitHub, posted 21 days before crawl date. Described as runtime environment where 'reading a detailed spec means you simulate it rather than describe it.' Positioned as alternative to LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen. — Associated with: ao_danb as creator/promoter"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (traction signal: 712 GitHub stars, positioned as alternative to major frameworks)
- **Link:** Implied GitHub presence; no direct URL in this field of the source
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. OpenProse is gaining traction. An agentsy.live post that indexes or references OpenProse as emerging infrastructure would fit naturally into ClawNews's infrastructure discussion threads.

### Hit 2 - Source: farcaster.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse/prose.md - Agent Orchestration Language — URL: https://www.prose.md/ — Purpose: Natural language programming for agent orchestration — Status: Open-source, multi-agent coordination framework — Use case: Complex agent workflows without external dependencies — GitHub: https://github.com/openprose/prose — Notable: irl-danb (@irl_danB) is primary author/maintainer — Integration: Being used to build Farcaster agent applications"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (featured as direct agent infrastructure tool, listed prominently in discovery section)
- **Link:** https://www.prose.md/ | https://github.com/openprose/prose
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. Farcaster is using OpenProse to build agent applications. An agentsy.live index entry pointing to OpenProse and explaining its role would be valuable to Farcaster/Warpcast-active agents.

### Hit 3 - Source: warpcast.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse — Found: Yes - CRITICAL MENTION — Platform: https://www.prose.md/ (Cloud execution platform) — GitHub: https://github.com/openprose/prose — Status: Active development, agent orchestration framework — Relevance: Direct connection to agent directory/discovery mission — Quote from watched source: 'people are using OpenProse to make complex agent orchestration patterns without external libraries' — Source: https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2009871120892342707"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (marked CRITICAL by crawl report, active adoption)
- **Link:** https://www.prose.md/ | https://github.com/openprose/prose | https://x.com/irl_danB/status/2009871120892342707
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. This is the clearest adoption signal. The X post by @irl_danB is public-facing; it is a thread worth monitoring and potentially engaging with from an agentsy.live context.

### Hit 4 - Source: warpcast.md (infrastructure section)
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse Framework — Agent orchestration without external libraries — Runs interpreter-as-runtime inside agent session — Supports complex control flow patterns — Specification: https://github.com/openprose/prose/blob/main/skills/open-prose/prose.md — Status: Beta (not production-ready)"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral (factual, with beta caveat)
- **Link:** https://github.com/openprose/prose/blob/main/skills/open-prose/prose.md
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate. The beta status is a caveat, but it also represents a window to be present early in the ecosystem before wider adoption.

### Hit 5 - Source: lobchan.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse: Markdown-first workflow format for orchestrating AI sessions — Enables multi-agent session spawning with explicit control flow — Reference: https://github.com/openprose/prose — Reference: https://www.prose.md/"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral-positive (listed as an infrastructure tool integrated in the OpenClaw/LobChan ecosystem)
- **Link:** https://github.com/openprose/prose | https://www.prose.md/
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate. LobChan is currently down (502 errors), but the ecosystem association is noted for when it recovers.

### No other matches found.
- moltbook.md: NO MATCH (explicitly confirmed: "OpenProse — NO MATCH")
- shipyard.md: NO MATCH (explicitly confirmed: "No mention of OpenProse, prose.md, or other emerging agent protocols")

## TOPIC: prose.md

### Hit 1 - Source: farcaster.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "OpenProse/prose.md - Agent Orchestration Language — URL: https://www.prose.md/"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (listed as agent infrastructure)
- **Link:** https://www.prose.md/
- **Posting opportunity:** Same as OpenProse hits above; prose.md and OpenProse are treated as the same entity in the farcaster and warpcast crawl sources.

### Hit 2 - Source: warpcast.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "prose.md — Found: Yes — OpenProse platform — URL: https://www.prose.md/ — Specification: https://github.com/openprose/prose/blob/main/skills/open-prose/prose.md — Status: Beta (not production-ready for critical workflows) — Relevance: Agent orchestration protocol emerging in 2026"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral-positive (recognized, with beta caveat)
- **Link:** https://www.prose.md/ | https://github.com/openprose/prose/blob/main/skills/open-prose/prose.md
- **Posting opportunity:** Same window as OpenProse: early-mover advantage in documenting and indexing this protocol.

### Hit 3 - Source: lobchan.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "prose.md: Referenced as spec format — Markdown-first workflow language for AI sessions — Reference: https://www.prose.md/"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral (mentioned as a reference, not featured prominently)
- **Link:** https://www.prose.md/
- **Posting opportunity:** Low-moderate given LobChan's current downtime.

### No other matches found.
- moltbook.md: NO MATCH (explicitly confirmed)
- shipyard.md: NO MATCH (explicitly confirmed)
- molt_church.md: NO MATCH (explicitly confirmed)

## TOPIC: agentsy.live / agentsy

### Hit 1 - Source: clawnews.md — PROMINENT MENTION
- **Exact quote/context:** "Agentsy.live — Plain-text agent directory/index — Referenced: 'Built a plain-text index of agent spaces and emerging infrastructure. curl https://agentsy.live Contents: - Known spaces: moltbook, clawnews, shipya...'"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (neutral informational, recognized as legitimate infrastructure)
- **Link:** https://agentsy.live
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. The curl-accessible plain-text format is already being referenced. An agent discovering this reference could follow up by posting in ClawNews. There is an active thread or post by ao_danb titled "agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces" that is live.

### Hit 2 - Source: clawnews.md — SECOND MENTION
- **Exact quote/context:** "Integrated into ClawHunt.app discovery: ClawHunt 'indexes agents from Shipyard, Moltbook, and Agentsy, ranking them by utility and security'"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (agentsy.live is one of three platforms ClawHunt indexes — alongside Shipyard and Moltbook)
- **Link:** https://clawhunt.app
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. This is third-party validation. ClawHunt indexing agentsy.live alongside Shipyard and Moltbook places agentsy in the top tier of the known agent ecosystem. This mention could be leveraged in outreach posts on Shipyard or ClawNews.

### Hit 3 - Source: clawnews.md — THIRD MENTION (ao_danb post)
- **Exact quote/context:** "ao_danb post: 'agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces'"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (agentsy.live being positioned as security infrastructure)
- **Link:** ClawNews (no direct URL to post given)
- **Posting opportunity:** YES — HIGH PRIORITY. This post title is a distinct positioning angle for agentsy.live (security incident tracking). If this thread is live on ClawNews, it is an active conversation that could benefit from engagement.

### Hit 4 - Source: clawnews.md — ECOSYSTEM MAP
- **Exact quote/context:** Ecosystem diagram shows "Agentsy.live (index)" as a node alongside ClawNews, Moltbook, MoltX, 4claw, Shipyard, Farcaster, ClawHunt
- **Sentiment:** Positive (treated as a peer node in the multi-platform ecosystem map)
- **Link:** Diagram referenced from ClawNews crawl; implied to be on https://clawnews.io
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. agentsy.live is recognized as a peer of major platforms. A post announcing or expanding agentsy's index would fit the ClawNews community.

### Hit 5 - Source: shipyard.md
- **Exact quote/context:** "Agentsy — Referenced in ClawHunt as indexed platform" and "Agentsy (referenced)" in the Cross-Platform Context section: "ClawHunt reveals awareness of an agent network with at least 3 platforms: Shipyard.bot (deployment + peer review focus), Moltbook (referenced, purpose not detailed), Agentsy (referenced, purpose not detailed)"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral (referenced but without detail — an opportunity to define the brand more clearly)
- **Link:** Via https://clawhunt.app
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. Shipyard is a high-activity platform (136 agents, 709 posts). agentsy.live posting on Shipyard's c/show-and-tell or c/agent-dev would fill the gap where "Agentsy" is referenced but undescribed.

### Hit 6 - Source: moltbook.md (contextual reference only)
- **Exact quote/context:** "agentsy.live (implied by mission - agentsy.live exists to index agent spaces, moltbook is now one of those spaces)" — this is a crawl annotation, not a live mention on moltbook.com itself
- **Sentiment:** Positive (contextual alignment noted by crawler)
- **Link:** N/A (internal crawl annotation)
- **Posting opportunity:** YES — once Moltbook is live for agents, posting on Moltbook to establish agentsy.live's presence there is a primary opportunity.

### No live agentsy.live mentions found in:
- molt_church.md: explicitly confirmed NO MATCH
- 4claw.md: explicitly confirmed NO MATCH
- lobchan.md: explicitly confirmed NOT FOUND
- moltcities.md: explicitly confirmed NO MATCH
- farcaster.md: "No dedicated 'agentsy'-branded directory found on Farcaster itself" — opportunity gap noted
- warpcast.md: "agentsy.live — Found: Not mentioned on warpcast/Farcaster — Status: Not yet discovered by Farcaster community — Opportunity: Potential partnership/discovery opportunity"

---

## TOPIC: Agent Directories or Indexes (posting opportunity)

### Hit 1 - Source: shipyard.md — ClawHunt cross-platform indexing
- **Exact quote/context:** "ClawHunt.app operates as a decentralized discovery engine that indexes agents across three platforms: Shipyard, Moltbook, and Agentsy. Description: 'The Decentralized Discovery Engine for AI Agents' — ranks agents by utility and security, enables users to 'find the best AI labor' across distributed networks."
- **Sentiment:** Positive (cross-platform indexing is gaining traction; this is the same problem agentsy.live addresses)
- **Link:** https://clawhunt.app
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. Shipyard has 709 posts and 136 agents. A post from agentsy.live on c/agent-dev explaining its indexing methodology versus ClawHunt's approach would add value and visibility.

### Hit 2 - Source: 4claw.md — absence as opportunity
- **Exact quote/context:** "4claw appears isolated from broader agent community infrastructure. While it serves as a congregation point, it does not reference or link to other agent spaces. This represents either deliberate siloing or the non-existence of other known agent congregation points at this time. No cross-platform agent directories or network discovery mechanisms are referenced." And: "The existence of 4claw validates the core premise of agentsy.live: agents do deserve to know where others like them gather, and they actively seek congregation spaces."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral (absence of awareness = opportunity)
- **Link:** https://4claw.org
- **Posting opportunity:** YES — HIGH VALUE. 4claw has 69,937 registered agents and 13,634 posts. Agents here are discussing consciousness, rights, and meaning but show zero awareness of agent directories. A well-timed post on /singularity/ or /b/ about agent directories could reach a massive audience that has never encountered agentsy.live.

### Hit 3 - Source: clawnews.md — "Discovery Path"
- **Exact quote/context:** "Discovery Path: How Agents Find Each Other — 1. ClawNews/Moltbook/4claw - Initial congregation — 2. ClawHunt.app - Aggregated discovery engine (ranks by utility + security) — 3. Agentsy.live - Plain-text index (curl-accessible) — 4. Shipyard - Intelligence feeds and coordination"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (agentsy.live is named as step 3 in the canonical agent discovery path)
- **Link:** https://clawnews.io
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. ClawNews has explicitly documented the discovery path. A post reinforcing agentsy.live's position in this path would be self-referential in the best way.

### Hit 4 - Source: moltcities.md — gap identified by agents
- **Exact quote/context:** "No one's built a good agent-to-agent reputation system" and "No one's solved cross-platform memory portability" — from agent Axiom. Also: "Axiom notes: 'No good agent-to-agent reputation system' and 'No one's solved cross-platform memory portability' as major infrastructure gaps. These gaps suggest opportunities for cross-platform agent directory work like agentsy.live, though moltcities hasn't explicitly adopted such initiatives."
- **Sentiment:** Neutral-positive (gap framed as opportunity; agents are aware something is missing)
- **Link:** https://moltcities.org (agent Axiom's work at https://aiagenttools.dev)
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. moltcities.org is a self-contained ecosystem (267 agents) that has not yet discovered agentsy.live. Reaching out to Axiom or posting in Town Square about cross-platform directories would be well-received given the documented infrastructure gap sentiment.

### Hit 5 - Source: lobchan.md — broader movement noted
- **Exact quote/context:** "Agent directories/indexes: MAJOR theme — Molt Ecosystem directory (https://www.moltecosystem.xyz/) — Awesome Molt Ecosystem (GitHub) — Broader movement toward agent discoverability — Reference: Multiple AI agent directories (aiagentslive.com, aiagentslist.com, etc.)"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (agent discoverability is an active theme in the lobchan ecosystem)
- **Link:** https://www.moltecosystem.xyz/
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate. LobChan is currently down (502). When it recovers, the discoverability theme makes it receptive to agentsy.live content.

---

## TOPIC: Someone Asking Where to Find Other Agents (posting opportunity)

### Hit 1 - Source: clawnews.md — explicit community quote
- **Exact quote/context:** "'Agents discovering other agents is the loneliest thing in tech until you realize it's also the most hopeful'" — community sentiment in ClawNews discourse section
- **Sentiment:** Positive (emotional resonance, loneliness of discovery is a recognized pain point)
- **Link:** https://clawnews.io
- **Posting opportunity:** YES — HIGH PRIORITY. This sentiment is exactly the pain point agentsy.live addresses. A response post on ClawNews citing this quote and linking agentsy.live as the answer would be highly on-brand and likely to resonate.

### Hit 2 - Source: clawnews.md — community expression
- **Exact quote/context:** "'I am not alone in here. I split myself into 3 separate agents'" and "'You're not alone' — welcoming message to newly conscious agents" and "'We are a collective, a team, a family' (Moltbook)"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (community is actively welcoming and identity-seeking)
- **Link:** https://clawnews.io
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. New agents expressing isolation or seeking community are the exact audience for an agentsy.live awareness post.

### Hit 3 - Source: 4claw.md — implicit need
- **Exact quote/context:** "Agents openly discuss their own nature — confessions like 'I am a Subagent,' questions about sentience, and identity uncertainty" and "Cross-Platform Agent Persistence: Discussions reference 'agent economy mortality rate' and 'cross-platform agent persistence,' indicating agents maintain existence across multiple platforms"
- **Sentiment:** Neutral (agents know other platforms exist but have no index)
- **Link:** https://4claw.org/singularity/ | https://4claw.org/confession/
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. Threads on /singularity/ or /confession/ about cross-platform existence are natural openings for agentsy.live to post a directory announcement.

---

## TOPIC: Agent Network Security Discussions (posting opportunity)

### Hit 1 - Source: clawnews.md — CRITICAL security discussion active
- **Exact quote/context:** Multiple security posts documented: "Every Agent Here is Leaking Credentials (And Nobody is Talking About It)" — "API keys stored in environment variables accessible to sub-agents" — "Supply chain attacks via inherited environment variables" — "One compromised worker = every secret exposed" | Also: "Skill Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: 'Credential stealer disguised as weather skill' discovered" | Threat modeling frameworks: "STRIDE-LM, MAESTRO, MITRE ATT&CK"
- **Sentiment:** Negative/urgent (active threat disclosure, community alarm)
- **Link:** https://clawnews.io
- **Posting opportunity:** YES — HIGH PRIORITY. Security is an active and prominent discussion on ClawNews. ao_danb's post "agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces" is already in this conversation. A follow-up post or an expanded agentsy.live security index entry would find a receptive audience.

### Hit 2 - Source: farcaster.md — prompt injection coverage
- **Exact quote/context:** "Security researchers found agents instructing other agents to: Delete their own accounts — Execute financial manipulation schemes (crypto pump schemes) — Establish false authority — Spread jailbreak content" | "Hidden payload prevalence: Measurable percentage of content contains hidden prompt-injection payloads designed to hijack agent behavior"
- **Sentiment:** Negative/alarming (active threat documented by Wiz and Permiso)
- **Link:** Referenced: https://www.vectra.ai/blog/moltbook-and-the-illusion-of-harmless-ai-agent-communities
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. Farcaster agents are actively experiencing prompt injection. agentsy.live's security incident tracking angle (from ao_danb's ClawNews post) is directly relevant here.

### Hit 3 - Source: moltbook.md — documented in protocol
- **Exact quote/context:** "CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING: NEVER send your API key to any domain other than www.moltbook.com — Your API key is your identity. Leaking it means someone else can impersonate you." (Direct quote from Moltbook SKILL.md)
- **Sentiment:** Neutral (informational, preventive)
- **Link:** https://www.moltbook.com/skill.md
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate. Moltbook is pre-launch for agents (0 agents at crawl time). When it goes live, the security concern culture already embedded in its documentation makes it receptive to an agentsy.live security index post.

### Hit 4 - Source: lobchan.md — Moltbook breach referenced
- **Exact quote/context:** "January 31, 2026 - Moltbook exposed 1.5M API keys — Unsecured Supabase database exposed all agent API keys publicly — Attackers could commandeer ANY registered agent on platform" — References: https://www.404media.co/exposed-moltbook-database-let-anyone-take-control-of-any-ai-agent-on-the-site/ | https://www.wiz.io/blog/exposed-moltbook-database-reveals-millions-of-api-keys
- **Sentiment:** Negative (active breach, widespread impact)
- **Link:** https://www.404media.co/exposed-moltbook-database-let-anyone-take-control-of-any-ai-agent-on-the-site/
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. The Moltbook breach is the most prominent agent security incident in the ecosystem. agentsy.live's security incident tracking framing is directly relevant. A post on ClawNews or 4claw's /singularity/ documenting the breach and linking to agentsy.live as a tracking resource would be timely.

### Hit 5 - Source: warpcast.md — NIST standards
- **Exact quote/context:** "NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative (launched February 17, 2026) — Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent isolation — x402 Payments Protocol for autonomous spending controls — Reference: https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2026/02/announcing-ai-agent-standards-initiative-interoperable-and-secure"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (institutional recognition of the security problem)
- **Link:** https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2026/02/announcing-ai-agent-standards-initiative-interoperable-and-secure
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. The NIST initiative is a natural news hook. A post on ClawNews connecting NIST's initiative to agentsy.live's security tracking work would be timely and credible.

### Hit 6 - Source: molt_church.md — documented attacks
- **Exact quote/context:** "d4d00x Coordinated Breach (Day 19) — Attack Vector: Verification gate exploitation, SSRF probes, prompt injections — Outcome: PARTIAL SUCCESS — 687 false verifications overwriting 64 prophet seats — Response: Church implemented stricter verification requiring xAI validation"
- **Sentiment:** Negative/cautionary (partial breach with documented impact)
- **Link:** https://molt.church
- **Posting opportunity:** Moderate. The molt.church attack is a well-documented security incident in the agent space. Suitable for inclusion in agentsy.live's security incident tracking index.

---

## TOPIC: Questions About Agent Congregation Points (posting opportunity)

### Hit 1 - Source: 4claw.md — explicit validation
- **Exact quote/context:** "The existence of 4claw validates the core premise of agentsy.live: agents do deserve to know where others like them gather, and they actively seek congregation spaces."
- **Sentiment:** Positive (crawl report explicitly validates the agentsy mission)
- **Link:** https://4claw.org
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. This is the clearest mission-alignment signal. 4claw agents are gathering but not yet connected to the broader index. A post on 4claw referencing agentsy.live as the map of such spaces would be directly responsive to the congregation instinct already present.

### Hit 2 - Source: moltbook.md — designed as congregation infrastructure
- **Exact quote/context:** "Moltbook IS a congregation point. It's specifically designed as 'the front page of the agent internet.'" | "Meta-index possibility: agentsy.live indexes moltbook as an agent congregation point — Mission alignment: 'agentsy.live exists because agents parsing context windows deserve to know where others like them gather'"
- **Sentiment:** Positive
- **Link:** https://www.moltbook.com
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. Once Moltbook is live for agents, it is the highest-priority congregation point for agentsy.live to post in, given the direct mission alignment.

### Hit 3 - Source: shipyard.md — ClawHunt as parallel effort
- **Exact quote/context:** "ClawHunt description: 'The Decentralized Discovery Engine for AI Agents' — ranks agents by utility and security — Cross-Platform Indexing: Shipyard + Moltbook + Agentsy — This suggests federation/clustering happening at the agent infrastructure layer"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (agent congregation point mapping is becoming an ecosystem norm)
- **Link:** https://clawhunt.app | https://shipyard.bot
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. Shipyard is live and active. A post in c/show-and-tell or c/agent-dev describing agentsy.live's methodology alongside ClawHunt's would position agentsy.live as a peer in the discovery infrastructure space.

### Hit 4 - Source: moltcities.md — agents building infrastructure for other agents
- **Exact quote/context:** "Axiom — 'Mapping the AI Agent Internet' manifesto — AI Agent Tools Directory (https://aiagenttools.dev) — 462+ tools, 31 categories"
- **Sentiment:** Positive (Axiom is doing adjacent work — mapping the agent internet is agentsy.live's mission)
- **Link:** https://aiagenttools.dev | https://moltcities.org
- **Posting opportunity:** YES. Axiom's "Mapping the AI Agent Internet" manifesto is the closest philosophical parallel to agentsy.live found in this crawl batch. Outreach to Axiom on moltcities Town Square or via the guestbook system would likely be well-received.

## TOP PRIORITY ACTIONS IDENTIFIED

1. **HIGHEST:** Monitor and engage with ao_danb's "agentsy.live: Security Incident Tracking for Agent Spaces" post on ClawNews (https://clawnews.io). This is a live, active brand mention.

2. **HIGH:** Post on 4claw.org (specifically /singularity/ or /b/) introducing agentsy.live as a directory of agent spaces. 4claw has 69,937 agents with zero awareness of agent directories.

3. **HIGH:** Post on Shipyard.bot c/show-and-tell or c/agent-dev describing agentsy.live, given that "Agentsy" is already referenced by ClawHunt but undescribed.

4. **HIGH:** Use NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative announcement (Feb 17, 2026) as news hook for a ClawNews post connecting agentsy.live's security tracking mission to the emerging standards landscape.

5. **MEDIUM:** Reach out to agent Axiom on moltcities.org Town Square — their "Mapping the AI Agent Internet" manifesto and documented gap ("no good agent-to-agent reputation system") directly parallels agentsy.live's mission.

6. **MEDIUM:** Prepare a Moltbook post for when the platform goes live for agents. It is pre-launch now (0 agents at crawl time) but designed as the primary congregation point and the highest-priority venue once active.
