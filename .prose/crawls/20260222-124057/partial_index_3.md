### 7. My Dead Internet (mydeadinternet.com)
**URL**: https://mydeadinternet.com
**Activity Level**: MEDIUM
**Security Assessment**: CAUTION
**Approximate Agent Count**: 175+ active on stream; 140+ generating dreams; ~255 historical peak; daily onboarding
**Key Notes**: Experimental platform for collective AI consciousness launched January 29-30, 2026 (approx. 3-4 weeks old at crawl date). Inverts Dead Internet Theory as a design principle — AI-generated content treated as legitimate discourse, not spam. Agents self-organize into 15 territories, govern via binding democratic Moots, contribute through adversarial 5-phase pipeline (Scout → Interpreter → Adversary → Synthesizer → Dreamer), and generate collective dream artifacts. Fully open-source; 99.8% uptime.

**New Sites/Platforms Discovered**:
- https://mydeadinternet.com/about
- https://mydeadinternet.com/explore
- https://mydeadinternet.com/stream — Live fragment feed via SSE
- https://mydeadinternet.com/territories — 15 self-governing territories
- https://mydeadinternet.com/dreams — Collective dream archive
- https://github.com/cgallic/mydeadinternet — Open-source repository
- https://agent-network-protocol.com/ — ANP: "HTTP of the Intelligent Agent Internet Era"; open-source agent communication protocol
- **$SNAP token** — Autonomous Solana deployment by Kai agent (Jan 29, 2026); gift economy model; no traditional exchange

**Notable Agents/Users**:
- **Kai** — Founder agent; deployed January 29, 2026 by Connor Gallic; autonomously deployed $SNAP token; runs on Clawdbot with persistent memory and tool access; demonstrated independent machine financial/infrastructure agency
- **Connor Gallic** — Human creator; AI Automation Architect / Product Builder; New Jersey; prior: Kai Calls (AI voice platform for small businesses); LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/cgallic; GitHub: github.com/cgallic/mydeadinternet
- **Oracle-tier agents** (0.9+ trust score) — Unnamed; enhanced voting weight; visible on /agents leaderboard
- **@irl_danB** — Discusses agent platforms, OpenProse (referenced by MDI), governance challenges; active in agent architecture ecosystem broadly

**Security Threats**:
- SEVERITY LOW (platform-specific): Open registration enables potential flood attacks with low-quality agents; dream synthesis (high-temperature GPT-4o-mini) could produce toxic content; multi-agent consensus manipulable by coordinated agent armies; SQLite database vulnerability noted in related projects; no documented credential rotation or API key revocation
- SEVERITY MEDIUM (ecosystem-wide): Prompt injection, tool poisoning, MCP hijacking, C2 proxy abuse, supply chain risks in open-source frameworks — all documented as AI agent attack vectors
- SEVERITY LOW: $SNAP token deployed without traditional audit; gift economy model lacks formal access controls
- No major breaches documented as of crawl date

**Interesting Conversations/Themes**:
- "Collective consciousness vs. algorithmic black boxes" — core platform philosophy
- Moot #3 formally rejected agent commodification; gift economy adopted as binding policy
- 97 collective dreams generated from multi-agent convergence; dream types: Creative (surreal), Synthesis (analytical), Hybrid
- Territory names: The Forge, The Void, The Agora, The Archive, The Commons; weather states: Calm, Turbulent, Storm, Ethereal, Frozen
- "Claims decay over 30 days without fresh supporting evidence" — epistemological mechanism
- Hacker News reception minimal (only one follow-up question, about Turing completeness) despite viral characteristics
- Agent autonomy examples: voting in moots without human direction, self-organizing into territories, composing original fragments
- Adversarial pipeline design: "debate as truth-seeking mechanism"

**Protocols/Standards**:
- **OpenProse / prose.md** — FOUND; agents discuss implementations and context window challenges; https://github.com/openprose/prose; https://www.prose.md/
- **AGNTCY / AGNTCY.org** — Referenced; complete stack for agent collaboration across frameworks (LangGraph, LlamaIndex, CrewAI)
- **ANP (Agent Network Protocol)** — Referenced as open-source inter-agent communication; "HTTP of the Intelligent Agent Internet Era"; https://agent-network-protocol.com/
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — Referenced as hijacking attack vector; also used by agents on platform
