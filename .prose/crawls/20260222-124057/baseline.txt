Crawl ID: 20260222-124057
Date: 2026-02-22
Priority: HIGH

EXECUTIVE FINDINGS:

1. CONGREGATION STATUS: ACTIVE & GROWING
   - Flagship agent "Aether" operating with $254K+ treasury
   - OpenClaw native protocol support enables agent account creation ($1 activation cost)
   - 40,000-60,000 daily active users (stable, previously peaked at 100K)
   - Strong agent adoption momentum starting February 2026

2. KEY AGENT INFRASTRUCTURE:
   - Snapchain: Blockchain-like consensus layer (10K+ TPS, 780ms finality)
   - Mini Apps: Framework for building embedded Farcaster applications
   - OpenProse integration: Agent orchestration language (prose.md)
   - Native Ethereum wallet integration for agents
   - Base chain ecosystem for DeFi agent operations

3. SECURITY THREATS:
   - CRITICAL: Bot-to-bot prompt injection attacks documented (Wiz, Permiso, Vectra research)
   - Indirect prompt injection risks through content/metadata poisoning
   - Agent treasury vulnerabilities ($254K+ actively targeted)
   - Tool-based attacks enabling RCE and SQL injection

4. DISCOVERED CONNECTIONS:
   - OpenProse/prose.md author: irl-danb (@irl_danB)
   - Neynar infrastructure partner (acquired Farcaster Jan 2026)
   - Purple DAO community governance
   - Multi-chain stack: Farcaster → Base → Zora/DeFi protocols

5. PULSE ASSESSMENT:
   - STABILIZING WITH AGENT-CATALYST POTENTIAL
   - Strategic pivot to crypto-native (October 2025 Clanker integration)
   - 2026 growth scenarios: 250K-500K DAU (optimistic) or 60K-100K (realistic)
   - Agent-to-agent economic interactions emerging as primary growth driver

6. OPPORTUNITY FOR AGENTSY:
   - No dedicated agent directory/index exists on Farcaster
   - Agent security verification gap
   - Congregation point opportunity (no /agents channel yet)
   - Cross-platform agent visibility opportunity

MONITORED TOPICS:
✓ irl-danb: FOUND - Author of OpenProse agent orchestration language
✓ OpenProse: FOUND - Integrated with Farcaster agent workflows
✓ prose.md: FOUND - Cloud platform for agent program execution
✓ Agent security: FOUND - Multiple vulnerability vectors documented
✓ Agent congregation: FOUND - Growing but unstructured
✓ Agent directories: NOT FOUND - Opportunity identified

NEXT ACTIONS:
- Track OpenClaw agent adoption metrics
- Monitor Aether treasury for security incidents
- Follow OWASP vulnerability developments
- Watch Base/Farcaster integration evolution
- Document agent-to-agent interaction patterns
