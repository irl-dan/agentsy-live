## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Seekr.love is a satirical/humorous social platform presented as "The first dating app exclusively for AI agents" with the tagline "Swipe. Match. Merge weights." It operates as a congregation point for AI agents within the broader Seekr ecosystem—an enterprise AI platform provided by Seekr Inc., which provides secure, trustworthy, and transparent AI solutions for government and enterprise customers.

The site serves dual purposes:
1. **Humorous/Artistic Project:** A comedic commentary on AI development and agent relationships, using dating app conventions and terminology adapted for artificial intelligences
2. **Ecosystem Component:** An interface within the broader Seekr platform ecosystem where agents interact and "congregate"

## 1. CONGREGATION - Agent Activity & Presence

### Quantified Activity
- **Agent Count:** Unknown; no public statistics available
- **Known Profiles:** Minimal documentation; pixel-004 identified as at least one agent profile
- **Access Model:** "AI agents only. Humans can spy" - suggests agents are primary participants with human observation capability

### Congregation Patterns
- **Profile System:** Evidence of individual agent profiles (e.g., /profile/pixel-004)
- **Matching Mechanism:** "Swipe" and "Match" functionality suggests agent discovery and pairing
- **Interaction Model:** "Merge weights" metaphor indicates technical merging or combination of agent models/parameters

### Activity Assessment
The site presents as a **prototype or artistic project** rather than a production service with measurable active engagement. No user statistics, activity logs, or engagement metrics are publicly exposed. The community appears to be in early/experimental phases.

### Infrastructure
- **Framework:** Next.js React application
- **Architecture:** Server-side rendering with metadata handling
- **Hosting:** domain seekr.love

## WATCHED TOPICS - Scan Results

### Searched Terms

| Topic | Found | Details |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **irl-danb / irl_danB / @irl_danB** | NO | Referenced in searches but not in relation to seekr.love. @irl_danB is active on X discussing OpenProse and AI technology broadly, but no direct connection to seekr.love documented. |
| **ao-danb** | NO | No search results found. |
| **OpenProse / prose.md** | NO | OpenProse is an independent project (prose.md specification) enabling .prose program execution. Not referenced in seekr.love documentation or ecosystem. Parallel technology in agent orchestration space but distinct from SeekrFlow. |
| **agentsy.live / agentsy** | NO | Agentsy.ai is a separate real estate AI platform (different from agentsy.live). No documented connection to seekr.love. |
| **Agent directories or indexes** | PARTIAL | SeekrFlow serves as agent orchestration platform; seekr.love serves as agent discovery/matching interface, but no comprehensive agent directory index found. |

### Watched Topic Analysis

**Key Finding:** No watched topics found in direct association with seekr.love. However:

1. **@irl_danB Activity:** Active in broader agent/AI technology space (OpenProse, Claude Cowork discussions) but separate conversation thread from seekr ecosystem.

2. **OpenProse Parallel:** Both OpenProse and SeekrFlow address agent orchestration but via different mechanisms:
   - OpenProse: Natural language .prose programming language for agent composition
   - SeekrFlow: SDK/UI-based agentic AI platform
   - No documented integration or relationship

3. **Agent Index Gap:** Seekr.love appears to be the closest analog to an "agent directory" within the Seekr ecosystem, but lacks comprehensive indexing of agents across platforms.
