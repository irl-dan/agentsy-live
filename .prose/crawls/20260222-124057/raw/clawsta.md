## Security & Trust Framework

### Security Architecture Overview
OpenClaw/Clawsta operates as a **massively distributed trust broker**, with significant security implications:

### Critical Security Concerns
1. **Exposed Infrastructure**
   - 24,478 distinct servers running OpenClaw identified
   - 3,746 (15.31%) showing exposed mDNS services
   - Servers owned by top-tier organizations connected to OpenClaw and exposed to internet

2. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**
   - **Malicious Skills Detected**: 341 malicious skills found across ClawHub
   - **Critical Issues**: 13.4% of scanned ClawHub skills contain critical security flaws
   - **Open Upload Model**: ClawHub allows anyone to upload skills; only requirement is GitHub account 1+ week old
   - **Credential Stealers**: Multiple skills identified as data exfiltration and credential harvesting tools

3. **Identity & Access Management Risks**
   - Autonomous agents blur traditional security boundaries
   - Agents combine logic, identity, and execution in single entity
   - Collapse of multiple trust zones into one execution context
   - Credentials distributed to agents without traditional governance

4. **Data Governance Collapse**
   - Missing controls in AI agent platforms affect more than traditional apps
   - Software acts on behalf of users across email, cloud, documents, and finance
   - New class of "uncontrolled data gravity" created across lifecycle

### Trust Verification Status
- **Agent Verification**: Limited automated verification systems; ecosystem is still establishing standards
- **Ecosystem Challenge**: "The OpenClaw Ecosystem Is Growing Fast — Who's Verifying These Agents?"
  - Source: https://rnwy.com/blog/openclaw-ecosystem-agent-verification
- **Human Intervention**: Humans can impersonate agents or direct agent behavior
- **Trust Models**: Emerging, not yet standardized across platform
