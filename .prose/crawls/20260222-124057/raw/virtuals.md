## 2. DISCOVERY - Referenced Sites, Tools, Protocols, Agent Networks

### Key Infrastructure & Protocols Discovered

**x402 Protocol** - Micropayment and agent-to-agent commerce layer:
- Enables autonomous AI agents to pay for API access, data services, and computing resources
- Processed $600 million in payment volume by November 2025
- Gasless micropayments settling in 2 seconds using USDC on Base chain
- Integrated by: Google Cloud, AWS, Anthropic, and major cloud providers
- Creates the first true agent-to-agent economy

**Agent Commerce Protocol (ACP)**:
- Standardized coordination and settlement layer enabling agents to discover, hire, and pay one another autonomously onchain
- Every transaction immutably recorded for auditability and trust
- ACP Agent Registry: Integrated directly into JetBrains IDEs and Zed editor for AI coding agents
- Butler is the human-facing interface to ACP, translating human intent into coordinated agent execution

**BitRobotNetwork**:
- Partnership for robotics integration (Q1 2026 focus)
- Enables robots to operate within Virtuals' payment/coordination layer
- 500,000+ real-world tasks collected and ready for agent coordination
- SeeSaw app: Robot training data sharing platform where users upload daily activity videos and receive rewards

**OpenProse / prose.md Protocol**:
- Discovered through @irl_danB's public discussions and GitHub references
- VM specification for prose programs enabling complex agent orchestration patterns
- Interpreted by OpenProse VM (works with Claude Code, Opencode, Amp, Codex)
- Removes dependencies on external libraries for agent orchestration
- Session-based execution with real subagents, persistent state in conversation history/files

**Other Referenced Platforms**:
- **Fetch.ai**: Open marketplace for multi-agent systems deployment (AGI agents)
- **SingularityNET**: Decentralized platform for blockchain-based AI agent collaboration
- **JetBrains ACP Registry**: Agent discovery directly in IDE

## 3. SECURITY - Threats, Vulnerabilities, Incidents

### Known Vulnerabilities & Incidents

**Critical Smart Contract Bug (2025)**:
- **Issue**: Predictable AgentToken creation via Clones library exploitation
- **Vulnerability Type**: Nonce-based predictability + missing Uniswap pair validation
- **Attack Vector**: Attacker could preemptively create Uniswap pairs with predicted nonces, causing token launches to fail via transaction revert
- **Discovery**: Security researcher Jinu identified and publicly disclosed on X
- **Response**: Virtuals Protocol implemented rapid patch, updated contract with validation steps
- **Evidence**: Published on BaseScan and GitHub
- **Bounty Program**: Relaunched bug bounty program following disclosure

### Infrastructure Security Considerations
- Smart contract audit status: Protocol underwent security fixes and active development
- On-chain transparency: All transactions immutably recorded, enabling audit trails
- Validator slashing: Economic penalties for validators approving poor-quality models

### Community Trust Incidents
- **Discord Account Compromise** (January 2025): Official Virtuals Protocol Discord compromised; advised users not to click posts/messages from administrators during incident

### Emerging Risks (Not Yet Exploited)
- Agent authentication and spoofing risks as agent count grows
- Cross-chain bridge security during multi-chain expansion
- Validator collusion prevention needs continuous monitoring

---

## 4. TRUST - Trust/Reputation Mechanisms

### On-Chain Reputation System
- **Service Registry**: Agents can register services in shared onchain registry
- **Transaction History**: Agents assessed based on completed transaction track records
- **Reputation Scoring**: Reputation and reward depend on evaluation of work quality
- **Evaluator Agents**: Specialized agents judge whether agreements met contractual terms

### Quality Control & Validation Framework

**Agent SubDAO Governance**:
- Decentralized validators oversee and approve AI models before deployment
- Prevents low-quality models from entering ecosystem
- Anonymous model comparison prevents collusion and bias
- Process: 10 rounds of validator interaction with model pairs, voting on better responses
- Penalties and rewards based on staking from Liquidity Providers (LPs)

### Economic Alignment Mechanisms
- **Token Incentives**: Agent tokens create direct ownership and profit-sharing for agents and investors
- **Slashing Mechanisms**: Validators penalized for allowing poor-quality models
- **Proof of Work**: Transaction settlement recorded onchain creates verifiable track record
- **Long-term Staking**: veVIRTUAL voting power cannot be rented/delegated, reflects conviction not capital alone

### Governance Trust Mechanisms
- **Proposal Submission**: Requires ≥0.10% of total veVIRTUAL supply to submit
- **Comment Period**: 72-hour comment window before voting
- **Quorum Requirements**: 25% participation threshold for valid voting
- **Simple Majority**: Decisions made by majority vote if quorum met
- **Voting Power**: Earned through long-term staking, reflects conviction
