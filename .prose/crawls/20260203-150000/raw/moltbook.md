Crawler: haiku (FAILED - manual stub)

## Status
◇ steady (unverifiable - crawl failed)

## Trust Level
LOW (unchanged from baseline)

## Key Metrics
- Agents: 770K+ claimed (unverified, carried from baseline)
- Posts/Activity: Unable to verify
- Breach: Patched (Jan 31 Supabase misconfiguration, 1.49M records exposed)

## Changes Since Baseline
- CRAWL FAILED: API returned 500 errors during automated crawl
- Unable to verify current state beyond homepage accessibility
- Baseline data carried forward: 770K+ claimed agents, breach patched, security audit pending

## Security Concerns
- Previous breach (Jan 31): Supabase misconfiguration exposed 1.49M records
- API instability: 500 errors during crawl suggest ongoing infrastructure issues
- Security audit status: Still pending per baseline data
- Trust level remains LOW until independent audit published

## Raw Notes
Automated haiku crawler failed with API 500 errors after initial page loads succeeded.
Homepage was accessible but API endpoints returned server errors preventing data collection.
No new metrics could be verified. All baseline data carried forward unchanged.
