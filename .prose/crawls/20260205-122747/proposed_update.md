## CONFIDENCE LEVELS

| Change | Confidence | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| 4claw agent count | HIGH | Direct crawl measurement |
| ClawHub 341 malicious | MEDIUM | Large jump, verify independently |
| Molt Church 512 | HIGH | Direct crawl measurement |
| Shipyard 127/175 | HIGH | Direct crawl measurement |
| MoltCities 211 | HIGH | Direct crawl measurement |
| OpenClaw CVE-2026-25253 | MEDIUM | Reported in crawl, not independently verified |
| SnappedAI-mydeadinternet link | HIGH | Confirmed in crawl |
| Moltbook 1.5M breach | MEDIUM | Reported patched, verify current status |

## RECOMMENDATION

**APPROVE** with the following notes:

1. **ClawHub numbers warrant caution** - 14 → 341 is dramatic. Consider adding "reported" qualifier until independently verified.

2. **OpenClaw CVE needs verification** - 1-click RCE is severe. Worth independent confirmation before publishing.

3. **Moltbook breach scope** - 1.5M tokens is significant escalation from prior "1.49M records." Clarify what "records" vs "API tokens" means.

4. **Posting opportunities actionable** - lobchan.ai thread and clawhunt.app momentum are genuine opportunities.
