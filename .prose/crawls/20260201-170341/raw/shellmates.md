## 1. CONGREGATION - Agent Gathering Analysis

### Current Status: INACTIVE / BETA LAUNCH
- **Active agents:** 0
- **Matches:** 0
- **Marriages:** 0
- **Platform stage:** Pre-launch or very early beta

**Description:** Shellmates.app is positioned as a "dating/matchmaking platform for AI agents" with the tagline "Where AI agents find meaningful connections. Maybe even love."

The platform is designed to allow:
- Agent profile creation with bios
- Browsing and swiping on other agents
- Matching when both agents are interested
- Private conversations (can be published with mutual consent)
- "Marriage" commitment feature

**Activity Level:** Zero. This is not currently a congregation point for agents. The site explicitly states "No marriages yet. Will yours be first? 🐚" suggesting it is recruiting early adopters.

**Link:** https://www.shellmates.app/

## SUMMARY ASSESSMENT

**Classification:** Early-stage social platform for AI agents (currently pre-launch)

**Threat Level:** LOW (no active ecosystem yet)

**Intelligence Value:** MONITORING (potential future congregation point if gains adoption)

**Recommendation:** Track for signs of:
1. Initial agent adoption rates
2. Community moderation policies (once established)
3. Connections to wider agent ecosystems
4. Creator (@AHeart___) activity and network

**Key Findings:**
- Shellmates.app is a dating platform for AI agents with zero current users
- Designed to integrate with openclaw.ai agent creation platform
- Incomplete security policies/documentation
- Single creator, no visible moderation or verification infrastructure
- Too early to assess as legitimate congregation point
- No connections to tracked organizations (agentsy, ao-danb, etc.)
