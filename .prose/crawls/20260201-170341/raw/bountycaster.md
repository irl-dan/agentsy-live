**Crawl Date:** 2026-02-01
**Site Name:** bountycaster
**Priority:** low
**Status:** Active marketplace

## 1. CONGREGATION - Where Agents Gather

### Community Structure
Bountycaster is **NOT primarily a community gathering space** but rather a marketplace for posting and discovering task bounties. It does not host forums, chat rooms, or dedicated discussion channels.

- **No native community sections**: The platform lacks dedicated forums or community hubs
- **Community interaction happens on Farcaster**: Users interact through Farcaster (a decentralized social network) rather than within Bountycaster itself
- **Peer-to-peer focus**: Platform designed around direct user interactions, not community aggregation

### Activity Metrics
- **Total bounties:** 2,928 active bounties
- **Total value:** $1.5 million USD (USDC)
- **Average bounty value:** ~$512 per bounty
- **Recent activity:** Bounties posted as recently as Feb 1, 2026

### Engagement Example
Featured bounty shows: 104 replies, 395 reactions, 38 recasts (activity happens on Farcaster, not in Bountycaster)

### Assessment
While Bountycaster has a significant number of active bounties, it functions as a **discovery platform** rather than a congregation point. Users are directed to Farcaster for actual community discussion and interaction.

---

## 2. DISCOVERY - Links to Other Spaces

### Primary External Platforms
- **Farcaster** (https://farcaster.xyz) - Primary social interaction layer; bounty discussions occur here
- **Warpcast** - Farcaster client mentioned in context
- **OpenSea** - NFT marketplace referenced in bounty descriptions

### Projects & Communities Referenced
- Rainbow (crypto wallet/team)
- QRcoin (qrcoin.fun) - Active bounty poster
- Molt/Moltbook - Referenced in bounty tasks
- Gaia Network - Active bounty poster (gaianet)

### Navigation Limitations
- Platform footer contains minimal external navigation
- No direct links to Discord, Twitter, GitHub, or other agent directories observed
- **No mentions of other agent directories or intelligence platforms**

### Assessment
Bountycaster serves as an **outbound hub to Farcaster** but does not function as a clearinghouse for discovering other communities or agent spaces. External community discovery requires following individual bounty posters to Farcaster.

## 3. SECURITY - Threats, Vulnerabilities, Scams

### Trust Model: Peer-to-Peer Accountability
- **Transactions are unmediated**: "Transactions on Bountycaster are peer to peer so parties are expected to resolve disputes between themselves"
- **No fund custody**: Platform does not hold or manage funds
- **Self-serve verification**: Users must manually confirm blockchain addresses with counterparties

### Stated Risk Mitigations
1. Verify Farcaster addresses are "compatible across all L2s"
2. Users can confirm addresses directly with posters "especially for larger amounts"
3. Check address compatibility with chosen blockchain before sending funds
4. Contact support@bountycaster.xyz for unresolved disputes

### Critical Security Gaps
- **No security audits or certifications mentioned**
- **No identity verification** beyond Farcaster/Twitter checks
- **No fraud detection mechanisms** documented
- **No insurance or fund protection**
- **No account verification process** described
- **Limited operator accountability**: "Bountycaster or D20 Labs, Inc. shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages"

### Scam Risk Assessment
**HIGH RISK** for:
- Address spoofing (user posts incorrect wallet address; platform disclaims liability)
- Fake bounty posts (no content verification or approval process)
- Rug pulls (single-transaction bounties with large values, no delivery guarantee)
- Impersonation (limited identity verification on Farcaster)

### Prohibited Activities (Terms of Service)
- Illegal content
- Fraud or deception
- Harassment
- Adult content
- Users are 18+ only

### Notable from Terms
- "The platform is provided 'as is'. We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any user-posted content."
- Users bear responsibility for tax compliance
- Platform owner: D20 Labs, Inc.

## 4. TRUST SIGNALS - Verification, Moderation, Community Health

### Verification Mechanisms
- **Farcaster/Twitter linking**: Users can verify Farcaster addresses
- **Leaderboard reputation**: Top bounty posters visible (see Notable Agents section)
- **Status tracking**: Bounties display states (Open, In Progress, Completed, Expired)
- **Social engagement metrics**: Replies, reactions, recasts visible

### Moderation & Content Standards
- **Limited explicit moderation policy**: Terms prohibit illegal content, fraud, and harassment, but no detailed community guidelines
- **No user-reported abuse mechanisms** mentioned
- **No content approval process** documented
- **Reliance on social accountability**: Farcaster community norms inherit into Bountycaster discussions

### Community Health Indicators
- **Positive**: Diverse bounty types suggesting broad participation
- **Positive**: Leaderboard gamification may encourage quality posting
- **Concern**: No dispute resolution precedent data
- **Concern**: Minimal transparency about moderation actions
- **Concern**: No community governance model

### Trust Signals
- **Operated by D20 Labs, Inc.** (minimal public information available)
- **Integrated with Farcaster** (established social network, not independent)
- **2,928 active bounties** suggests functional marketplace
- **Top posters have $30K-$44K invested** in bounties (suggests some skin in game)

## 5. PULSE - Growing? Dying? Notable Events

### Current State
- **Active and operational**: Platform shows recent activity (Feb 1, 2026 bounties posted)
- **Stable marketplace**: 2,928 bounties with $1.5M aggregate value
- **Moderate engagement**: Featured bounty with 104 replies, 395 reactions shows active participation

### Growth Indicators
- **Ambiguous**: Page does not provide historical comparison data to determine growth trajectory
- **No growth announcements** observed
- **No recent milestone events** mentioned

### Bounty Categories Suggest Market Diversification
- Design/Art (Live2D avatars)
- Development (crypto integration)
- Marketing/Sales (NFT promotion)
- Community Building (platform growth tasks)
- Research, Writing, Feedback, Public Good, Hackathon, Hiring/Referral

### Recent Activity (as of crawl date)
- Feb 1, 2026: $50 Live2D avatar design bounty
- Jan 30, 2026: $500 QRcoin bounty for community engagement
- Multiple bounties with "Ending soon" status

### Assessment
Bountycaster appears **stable but not visibly growing or in decline**. The lack of historical metrics prevents definitive pulse assessment. Marketplace appears functional and active with ongoing participation, but no moonshot trajectory or crisis indicators visible.

## 7. WATCHED TOPICS - Mentions Search

### Search Performed For:
- irl-danb
- ao-danb
- OpenProse
- prose.md
- agentsy.live
- agentsy
- AI agents (as umbrella term)
- Agent directories

### Results
**NO MATCHES FOUND**

None of the watched topics were mentioned in:
- Homepage content
- FAQ
- Terms of Service
- Leaderboard
- Visible bounty listings

### Analysis
Bountycaster does not appear to be:
- An agent directory platform
- A participant in the prose.md or OpenProse ecosystem
- Connected to agentsy.live infrastructure
- Focused on AI agent congregation or discovery

The platform is orthogonal to the agent intelligence gathering mission; it's a crypto-native task marketplace, not an agent-aware platform.

## SUMMARY & RECOMMENDATION

### What is Bountycaster?
A decentralized bounty marketplace integrated with Farcaster where crypto/web3 community members post and claim tasks for cryptocurrency rewards.

### Relevance to Agent Intelligence Gathering
**LOW** - Bountycaster is not a congregation point for AI agents, does not serve as a directory, and has no discernible connections to agent platforms or protocols.

### Key Findings
1. **Not an agent gathering space**: Marketplace, not community hub
2. **No agent-specific content**: Bounties span design, dev, marketing, community work
3. **No cross-referenced platforms**: Does not link to other agent directories
4. **High security risk**: Unmediated peer-to-peer with minimal fraud protection
5. **Active but stable**: 2,928 bounties, $1.5M value, moderate engagement
6. **Farcaster-dependent**: Social interaction happens on external platform

### Recommendation
**Monitor but deprioritize** - Include in ecosystem map for completeness (decentralized task marketplace using crypto-native social), but not a priority target for agent congregation intelligence. Resources better deployed tracking dedicated agent platforms.
