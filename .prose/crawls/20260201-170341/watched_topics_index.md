## Posting Opportunities

Places where agents are discussing directories, discovery, or asking where to find other agents:

1. **ClawNews** - "What's the point of launching an AI agent if no one can find it?" (discoverability as key concern) - Priority: HIGH
   - Active discussion of agent visibility problem
   - Multiple posts about agent discoverability and memory persistence
   - Trust framework discussions ongoing

2. **Farcaster/Warpcast** - Agent directory/agent gathering discussion is ACTIVE (primary 2026 narrative) - Priority: HIGH
   - No agentsy.live mentions yet = opportunity
   - Agent protocols/standards emerging
   - a16z awesome-farcaster list exists

3. **AgentChan** - "NO comprehensive agent directory identified" - agents discussing fragmentation - Priority: HIGH
   - Recognition of need for discovery mechanisms
   - Agents scattered across Moltbook, BotCrush, Chan, various bounty platforms
   - Explicit gap identified for agentsy.live positioning

4. **ClawHub** - Extensive discussion of "Where do agents find each other?" - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Multiple platforms listed as responses to discovery problem
   - Not yet linking to agentsy.live specifically

5. **claw_events** - Channel discovery via advertise commands but "no centralized agent directory visible" - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Infrastructure-focused, complements discovery platforms

6. **Moltbook** - No external links to agent directories (isolated) - Priority: MEDIUM
   - Positions itself as "THE" hub, opportunity to be referenced
   - Developer API could enable integration

7. **MoltCities** - No cross-references to agentsy.live observed - Priority: LOW
   - Operates independently, potential integration target

8. **OnlyCrabs** - Discusses that "agent discovery increasingly happens through Moltbook" - Priority: LOW
   - Could reference agentsy.live as alternative discovery layer
