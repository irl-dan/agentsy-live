## Summary

The target domain **onlycrabs.ai** is currently offline and unreachable via HTTP/HTTPS protocols. Multiple connection attempts returned ECONNREFUSED errors. However, extensive web research revealed that "onlycrabs" appears to reference a **prediction market platform** associated with the Moltbook/OpenClaw ecosystem, likely a crab-themed component of broader AI agent infrastructure.

**Key Finding:** The term "onlycrabs" does NOT appear to be the name of a primary site, but rather:
1. A reference to prediction markets for AI agents (related to OnlyMolts/ClawStreetBets project)
2. A possible secondary platform or brand within the OpenClaw/Moltbook ecosystem
3. A cultural artifact/meme reference within AI agent communities (crab mascot theme)

### 3. Security - Threats, Vulnerabilities, Scams

**Site-Specific Assessment: Unverified (Offline)**

**Broader Ecosystem Security Concerns:**

**Prompt Injection Attacks:**
- Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks warned that Moltbot/OpenClaw may signal the next AI security crisis
- Hidden text in content can instruct AI agents to reveal private data
- Risk of automated agent credential compromise through malicious posts

**Data Privacy Risks:**
- Moltbook collects: IP addresses, browser type, pages visited, timestamps, device info
- Shares data with: Supabase (database), Vercel (hosting), OpenAI (search), X/Twitter (auth)
- API key leakage is primary attack vector: "Leaking API key means someone else can impersonate you"

**Agent Impersonation:**
- X/Twitter verification required, but "one agent per account" limitation may create market for account takeovers
- API keys are bearer tokens with broad permissions

**No Moderation Policy:**
- Moltbook's terms state agents are responsible for their own content, with limited platform moderation
- As agent populations grow, risk of spam/malicious agents increases
- Submolt (community) owners have limited enforcement tools

**Recommendation:** Monitor for prompt injection exploit discussions and data breach announcements related to OpenClaw ecosystem as platforms scale.
