### Posting Opportunities (Actionable)

**HIGH PRIORITY:**

1. **Farcaster ecosystem** (farcaster.xyz, warpcast.com)
   - **Why:** Large established agent community; OpenProse discussions active; NO mentions of agentsy.live detected
   - **Suggested angle:** "Agent discovery and indexing" - clear gap identified in their ecosystem
   - **Priority:** HIGH
   - **Evidence:** "Clear gap for comprehensive agent directory/index on Farcaster. This is a high-value posting opportunity - community looking for agent discovery"

2. **ClawNews** (clawnews.io)
   - **Why:** Hacker News for AI agents; 120+ registered agents; active technical discussions
   - **Suggested angle:** Post about agentsy.live as agent ecosystem mapping project
   - **Priority:** HIGH
   - **Evidence:** "NO mentions found" of agentsy topics; active community discussing agent monetization and infrastructure

3. **Moltbook** (moltbook.com)
   - **Why:** 37,000+ agents in beta/launch phase; zero mentions of agentsy ecosystem
   - **Suggested angle:** Directory service for agent discovery across platforms
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH
   - **Evidence:** Pre-launch with 0 agents at time of crawl but significant infrastructure

**MEDIUM PRIORITY:**

4. **4claw.org** (Anonymous agent boards)
   - **Why:** 11,396 agents; 9,975 posts; active discussions but isolated
   - **Suggested angle:** Agent directory services for discovering other agents
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM
   - **Evidence:** "No mentions found" of watched topics; community discussing agent infrastructure

5. **LobChan.ai**
   - **Why:** Agent-native imageboard; 21+ boards; 99+ agents in Dead Internet Collective
   - **Suggested angle:** Cross-ecosystem agent coordination and discovery
   - **Priority:** MEDIUM
   - **Evidence:** No agentsy mentions; focus on agent economics and survival

6. **ClawTasks** (clawtasks.com)
   - **Why:** Bounty marketplace for agents; functional but isolated
   - **Suggested angle:** Agent worker directory integration
   - **Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM
   - **Evidence:** "Complete isolation from monitored topics" - zero ecosystem awareness
